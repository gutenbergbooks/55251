<h3>CHAPTER IV.—THE COST OF INTEMPERANCE.</h3>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Shall we sow tares and pray for bread?”—<i>Abd el Wahab.</i><a href="#temperance1" id="anch_temperance1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

</div>

<p>If we consider the manifold afflictions which in the after
years of so many millions of our fellowmen outweigh the happiness
of childhood, we can hardly wonder that several great
thinkers have expressed a serious doubt if earthly existence
is on the whole a blessing. Yet for those who hold that
the progress of science and education will ultimately remove
that doubt, it is a consoling reflection that the greatest of all
earthly evils are avoidable ones. The earthquake of Lisbon<a href="#temperance2" id="anch_temperance2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
killed sixty thousand persons who could not possibly have
foreseen their fate. In 1282 an irruption of the Zuyder Sea
overwhelmed sixty-five towns whose inhabitants had not five
minutes’ time to effect their escape. But what are such calamities
compared with the havoc of wanton wars, or the ravages
of consumption and other diseases that are the direct consequences
of outrageous sins against the physical laws of God?
The cruelty of man to man causes more misery than the rage
of wild beasts and all the hostile elements of Nature, but the
heaviest of all evils in our great burden of self-inflicted woe is
undoubtedly the curse of the poison vice. The alcohol habit
is a concentration of all scourges. In the poor island of Ireland
alone one hundred and forty million bushels of bread-corn
and potatoes are yearly sent to the distillery. The shipment
of the grain, its conversion into a health-destroying drug,
the distribution and sale of the poison, are carried on under
the protection of a so-called civilized government. <i>Waste</i> is
not an adequate word for that monstrous folly. If the grain
farmers of Laputa<a href="#temperance3" id="anch_temperance3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> should organize an expedition to the sea-coast,
and under the auspices of the legal authorities equip an
apparatus for flinging a hundred million sacks of grain into
the ocean, the contents of those sacks would be lost, and there
would be an end of it. The sea would swallow the cargo.
The distillery swallows the grain, but disgorges it in the form
of a liquid fire that spreads its flames over the land and
scorches the bodies and souls of men till the smoke of the torment
arises from a million homesteads. We might marvel at
the extravagance of the Laputans, but what should we say if
the priests of a pastoral nation were to slaughter thousands of
herds on the altar of a national idol, and in conformity with
an established custom let the carcasses rot in the open fields
till the progress of putrefaction filled the land with horror and
pestilence; if moreover, among the crowd of victims we should
recognize the milch cows of thousands of poor families whose
children were wan with hunger, and if furthermore the intelligent
rulers of that nation should supervise the ceremonies of
the sacrifice, distribute the carcasses and calmly collect statistics
to ascertain the percentage of the resultant mortality?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcapuc">LOSS OF LIFE</span> caused by the ravages of the alcohol
plague equals the result of a perennial war. The most belligerent
nation of modern times, the Russians, with the perpetual
skirmishes on their eastern frontier, and their periodical campaigns
against their southern neighbors, lose in battle a yearly
average of 7,000 men. The average longevity of the Caucasian
nations is nearly 38 years. Of their picked men about 45
years. The average age of a soldier is now-a-days about 25
years. The death of 7,000 soldiers represents therefore a national
loss of 7,000 times the difference between 25 and 45
years, <i>i. e.</i>, a total waste of 140,000 years. Medical statistics
show that in the United States alone the direct consequences
of intoxication cost every year the lives of six thousand persons,
most of them reckless young drunkards, who thus anticipate
the natural term of their lives by about twenty years.
But at the very least, two per cent. of our population is addicted
to the constant use of some form of alcoholic liquors. Prof.
Neison, of the British General Life Insurance Company, estimates
that rum-drinkers shorten their lives by seven years,
beer-drinkers by five and one-half, and “mixed drinkers” by
nine and one-half years. For the city of London, Sir H.
Thompson computes that drinkers of all classes shorten their
lives by six years. But let us be quite sure to keep within the
limits of facts applying to all conditions of life, and assume a
minimum of four years. A total of 4,120,000 years for the
population of the United States is therefore a moderate estimate
of the annual life waste by the consequences of the poison
vice! In other words, in a country of by no means exceptionally
hard drinkers, alcohol destroys yearly thirty times as
much life as the warfare of the most warlike nation on earth.
The first year of the war for the preservation of the Union and
the suppression of slavery cost us 82,000 lives. When the
death list had reached a total of 100,000 the clamors for peace
became so importunate that the representatives of our nation
were several times on the point of abandoning the cause of the
most righteous war ever waged. Yet the far larger life waste
on the altar of the Poison-Moloch continues year after year,
and for a small bribe not a few of our prominent politicians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
seem willing to perpetuate that curse to the end of time.
Among all the nations of the Christian world, with the only
exception of the Syrian Maronites,<a href="#temperance4" id="anch_temperance4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> the poison vice has
shortened the average longevity of the working classes by at
least five years. Political economists have calculated the consequent
loss of productive force, but there is another consideration
which is too often overlooked. The progress of degeneration
has reduced our life term so far below the normal
average that the highest purposes of individual existence are
generally defeated. Our lives are mostly half-told tales. Our
season ends before the harvest time; before the laborer’s task
is half done he is overtaken by the night when no man can
work. The secret of longevity would, indeed, solve the chief
riddle of existence, for the children of toil could then hope to
reach the goal of the visible compensation which, on earth at
least, is now reserved for the exceptional favorites of fortune.
That hope is diminished by everything that tends still further
to reduce our shortened span of life, and beside increasing
the burdens of existence, the poison vice therefore directly decreases
the possibility of its rewards.</p>

<p>Yet that result is almost insured by the <span class="smcapuc">LOSS OF HEALTH</span>
which all experienced physiologists admit to be the inevitable
consequence of the stimulant habit. Every known disease of
the human system is aggravated by intemperance. The morbid
diathesis, as physicians call a predisposition to organic
disorders, finds an ally in alcohol that enables it to defy the
expurgative efforts of Nature. A consumptive toper will fail to
derive any benefit from a change of climate. A dram-drinking
dyspeptic can not be cured by outdoor exercise. The influence
of alcoholic tonics tends to aggravate nervous disorders
into mental derangements. But even the soundest constitution
is not proof against the bane of that influence. Before
the end of the first year habitual drinkers lose that spontaneous
gayety which constitutes the happiness of perfect health as
well as of childhood. The system becomes dependent upon
the treacherous aid of artificial stimulants, and the lack of vital
vigor soon begins to tell upon every part of the organism.
Alcohol counteracts the benefit of all the hygienic advantages
of climate and habit, and it is doubtful if the effect of its continued
influence could be equaled by the intentional introduction
of contagious diseases. A medical expert might collect
the most incurable patients in the leper slums of Shanghai, in
the lazarettos<a href="#temperance5" id="anch_temperance5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> of Naples and the fever hospitals of Vera Cruz,
and distribute them in the cities of another country; yet a year
after the dissemination of such diseases the hygienic condition
of a temperate nation would be better than that of a drunkard
nation after a year of the strictest quarantine protection. In
the sanitary history of the Caucasian nations alcohol has
proved a worse plague than the Black Death.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcapuc">WASTE OF LAND</span> and the <span class="smcapuc">WASTE OF LABOR</span> must be considered
together, in order to comprehend the total amount of
the loss which the fourteen most civilized nations inflict on
themselves by the unspeakable folly of devoting from 20 to 25
per cent. of their fertile area to the production of stimulating
poisons. If the land thus abused were simply neglected, if it
were abandoned to the weeds and tares, the laborers who now
cultivate it in the interest of hell might employ their time in
assisting their friends and help them to cultivate better or
larger crops on the soil of the adjoining lands. If they should
prefer to emigrate, their abandoned fields might be cultivated
by their neighbors. Even children in the intervals of their
play might plant cherry stones, and help the soil to contribute
to the welfare of the community. As it is, it contributes only
to the development of diseases, vices and crimes. The productions
of the land, the toil of the husbandmen, are not only
utterly lost, but become a curse to the population of the country.
Starving Ireland devotes a third of her arable lands to
the production of distillery crops. Spain begs with one hand
and with the other flings two-fifths of her produce to the poison
vender. The statistics of the last census show that distilleries
devour every year 34,300,000 acres of our total farm produce;
breweries, 9,600,000; wine cellars, cider mills (not to mention
tobacco factories), about five millions more!</p>

<p>The old settlers of western Arkansas still remember the excitement
caused by occasional raids of predatory Indians who
used to cross the Texas border and devastate the farms of the
frontiersmen. Near Arkadelphia they once burned three hundred
acres of ripe corn, and half a dozen counties joined in the
pursuit of the marauders. Imagine the blazing indignation,
the mass meetings, the general uprising of an outraged people,
if the Mormons should take it in their heads to burn three
million acres of our grain crop. Yet the distillers not only
burn up more than the tenfold amount, but fan the flames to
kindle a soul and body consuming conflagration, and shriek
about infringements of their privileges if a bold hand here
and there succeeds in snatching a brand from the burning.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcapuc">WASTE OF REMEDIAL EXPENDITURE</span> must be considered
under a separate head, for beside squandering their own resources,
the votaries of the poison fiend waste those of their
neighbors, who have to devise means for mitigating the resulting
mischief. The care of drunkards, <i>i. e.</i>, of persons
picked up in the streets in a state of life-endangering intoxication,
costs our hospitals a yearly sum of $5,000,000. A list of
the various diseases which can be traced to the direct or indirect
influence of intemperance would require the enumeration
of nearly all known disorders of the human organism, but,
though drunkards become a burden to their families oftener
than to the charitable institutions of the community, it has been
ascertained that they constitute 30 per cent. of the inmates of
such establishments as county infirmaries, charity hospitals,
almshouses, poorhouses and lunatic asylums. Prisons
proper, that is, institutions for the cure of moral disorders, are
filled with patients where derelictions in forty out of a hundred
cases have been committed either under the immediate influence
of intoxicating liquors, or as a consequence of such direct
results of intemperance as loss of property, loss of credit, loss
of moral or mental integrity. In 1870 the prisons of the United
States cost the nation a yearly sum of $87,000,000. By this
time their cost probably amounts to a full hundred millions.
The magistrates of our city courts have to waste half their time
on the trial of drunkards. On the blackboards of our metropolitan
station houses “D. D. C.” after the name of a prisoner
means So-and-So locked up for drunkenness and disorderly
conduct; they have to abbreviate the specification of that offense
to save a little space for other memoranda. If the indirect
consequences of the poison vice could be traced through
all their ramifications, it would be found that the suppression of
that vice would relieve our cities from a burden equivalent to
a full half of all their municipal taxes.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcapuc">MORAL LOSS</span> is not confined to the direct influence of the
brutalizing poison. The liquor traffic defiles all participants of
a transaction which involves a sin against Nature, a crime
against society and posterity, and an outrage against the moral
instincts of the veriest savage, for more than five thousand
years ago the lawgivers of the Bactrian nomads<a href="#temperance6" id="anch_temperance6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> recorded their
protest against the vice of intoxication. A drunkard who
flees from the prohibitory laws of his native place can not escape
the voice of an inner monitor. The liquor dealer who
points to his license is not the less conscious that he is an
enemy of mankind, and that his servants eat the wages of a
soul and body corrupting vice. The lawgiver who can be
bribed to connive at that vice not only sins against the laws of
political economy, but against Nature and the first principles
of natural ethics, and forfeits his claim to the respect of the
community. Faith in the sanctity of the law, in the wisdom
and integrity of the legislator, is the very corner-stone of public
morals, but that faith is incompatible with a system of legalized
crime, and the lawgiver who consents to sanction the outrage
of the poison traffic undermines the basis of his authority, and
thereby the authority of the law itself. It is wholly certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
that larceny and perjury combined do not damage the state
the hundredth part as much as the curse of the poison vice;
yet what should we think of the moral status of a legislative
assembly devising a plan to increase the national revenues by
granting license to pickpockets and professional false witnesses?
Imagine a Titus Oates<a href="#temperance7" id="anch_temperance7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> offering his services on the
public streets, and a chief justice compelling the courts to recognize
the legality of his business, and protect him in the enjoyment
of its emoluments! Imagine Jack Sheppard<a href="#temperance8" id="anch_temperance8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> filching
the weekly wages of a half-witted working man, and flaunting
a government license if the wife of his victim should demand
the restitution of the plunder. The absurdity of such an arrangement
might seem too glaring to imagine its possibility.
Yet for the same reason posterity may refuse to credit the records
of our liquor system; for, translated into plain speech,
the contract between the state and the rum vender means even
this: “On condition of receiving a share in the yearly profits
of your business, I herewith grant you the right to poison your
fellow-citizens.”</p>

<p>The <span class="smcapuc">LOSS OF WEALTH</span>, which some of the foregoing considerations
will enable us to estimate, has increased with the
progress of our national development in a way which in many
respects has made that progress a curse instead of a blessing.
Thirty-five years ago our brethren in Maine had a hard fight
against the champions of the liquor traffic, but they had to deal
with whiskey alone. Since then our foreign immigrants have
introduced ale, lager beer, and French high wines, and
threaten to introduce <i>absinthe</i><a href="#temperance9" id="anch_temperance9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and opium. The poison vice
has assumed the magnitude of a pandemic plague. According
to the statistics of the Treasury Department, the alcohol
drinkers of the United States spent during the last ten years
a yearly average of $370,000,000 for whiskey, $53,000,000 for
other distilled liquors, $56,000,000 for wine, and $140,000,000
for ale and beer. Together, $624,000,000 a year. Under the
head of liquors evading the revenue tax, Prof. W. Hoyle, of
Manchester, adds 20 per cent. for Great Britain, Commissioner
Halliday 15 per cent. for the United States, and Dr. Bowditch
18 per cent. for the state of Massachusetts alone. Let us assume
the minimum of 15 per cent. The total direct cost of
the poison vice (without including tobacco and other narcotic
stimulants) is therefore $705,000,000 a year. The indirect
cost eludes computation, except under the three following
heads: 1. The loss of productive capacity, as revealed in the
difference between the yearly earnings of a manufacturing
community under the protection of prohibitory laws or under
the influence of the license system. 2. The inebriate percentage
of patients in our public hospitals, and of convicts in our
prisons. 3. The loss sustained by the employers of agents,
trustees, clerks, etc., addicted to the use of intoxicating liquors.
The aggregate of these indirect losses we will assume to be
only $350,000,000 a year, though several political economists
compute it as <i>equal to the direct cost</i>. Our estimate does not
include the amount of rum-begotten distress relieved by private
charity, nor the rum percentage of undetected crime, nor
yet the wholly incalculable value of the benefactions, reforms
and improvements <i>prevented</i> by the use of intoxicating liquors
among the upper classes. We can therefore be quite sure of understating
the truth if we estimate the aggregate cost of the poison
vice at $1,055,000,000 a year—a yearly sum equivalent to the
cost value of all our public libraries, our church property, school
property, steamboats, bridges, and telegraphs taken together.</p>

<p>Prohibition would put a stop to one half of that prodigious
waste. We will not delude ourselves with the hope that the
deep-rooted habit of the stimulant vice could at once be wholly
eradicated by any legislative measures whatever. For
years to come 20 per cent. of the aggregate would undoubtedly
be devoured by liquor venders finding means to elude the
vigilance of the law. Fifteen per cent. would be spent on
other vices. Fifteen per cent. more would probably be wasted
for frivolous purposes—innocent, as compared with the crime
of the poison traffic, but still on the whole amounting to a loss
of national resources. The waste of the remaining fifty per
cent. could be prevented by prohibition. In ten years the saving
of that sum and its application to useful purposes would
transform the moral and physical condition of our country.
With five billion dollars we could construct ten bridges over
every one of our hundred largest rivers. We could build an
international railroad of a gauge that would enable the denizens
of snow-bound New England to reach the tropics in
twenty-four hours. We could realize Professor Lexow’s project
of providing every large city with a system of free municipal
railways connecting the centers of commerce with the
suburban homes of the workingmen. We could make those
suburbs attractive enough to drain the population of the slums.
We could counteract the temptations of the grog-shops by providing
the poor with healthier means of recreation; city parks
with free baths, competitive gymnastics and zoölogical attractions
for the summer season, and reading rooms with picture
galleries and musical entertainments for the long winter evenings.
We could employ home missionaries enough for a direct
appeal to every fallen or tempted soul in the country. We
could cover our hillsides with orchards and line our highways
with shade trees; we could plant forest trees enough to redeem
thousands of square miles in the barren uplands of the West.
Each township in the country could have a free school, each
village a free public library; we could help the sick by teaching
them to avoid the causes of disease; we could prevent
rather than punish crime; we could teach our homeless vagrants
the lessons of self-support, and found asylum colonies
for the lost children of our great cities. And moreover, we
could increase the savings of the next decade by the endowment
of a National Reform College, with a corps of competent
sanitarians and political economists, for the training of temperance
teachers, with local lecturers, traveling lecturers, and
free lecture halls in every larger city of the country.</p>

<p>Only thus prohibition could be brought to answer its whole
purpose, for we should remember that the practical efficiency
of all government laws depends on the consensus of the
governed. Without the coöperation of the teacher the mandates
of the legislator fall short of their aim. But it is equally
certain that in the field of social ethics the teacher can not dispense
with the aid of the legislator, and that our lawgivers
can not much longer afford to ignore that truth, for the penalty
of the neglect already amounts to the equivalent of the average
yearly income of <i>seven million working people</i>. In the South
a million men, women and children of farm laborers earn less
than a hundred millions a year, <i>i. e.</i>, $500 for every family of
five persons. In the manufacturing districts of the North they
would earn less than $200,000,000. We can therefore again
be wholly certain of not overstating the truth, if we assert that
in the United States alone the poison vice devours every year
the aggregate earnings of more than <i>fourteen hundred thousand
families</i>. In one dollar bank-notes of the United States
Treasury, one billion dollars could be pasted together into a
paper strip that would reach up to the moon. Stacked up in
bundles, they would form a paper pile a hundred feet long,
fifty feet wide, and fifty feet high.</p>

<p>If the equivalent of so many creature-comforts could be employed
for the benefit of the poor, it would almost realize the
dreams of a Golden Age. But even if we could save it from
the hands of the poison vender by burning it on the public
streets, all friends of mankind would hail the conflagration as
the gladdest bonfire that ever cheered the hearts of men. For
its flames would save more human lives than the perpetual
peace of the millennium; it would prevent more crimes than
the civilization of all the savages that infest the prairies of our
border states and the slums of our large cities. Nay, it would
save us from evils for which mankind has thus far discovered
no remedy, for intemperance robs us of blessings which human
skill is unable to restore.</p>

<p>Think of God as your constant benefactor—that he made
you, that he sustains you in every moment of your existence—that,
to express yourself with the simple energy of inspiration,
in him you live, and move, and have your being—that in all
the joys which are scattered over the pilgrimage of life, we see
nothing but the kindness of God always exerting itself in our
favor, and meeting us in every direction—that though we seldom
look beyond the creatures which surround us, it is God
who reigns in these creatures and makes them subservient to
his most wise, his most gracious, his most benevolent purposes;
that though in the hey-day of youth we are carried along
the tide of gayety without care and without reflection, it is God
who gives to the spirit of man all its cheerfulness; that though
we stop short in our gratitude at the benefactor who relieved
and at the friend who supported us, it is God who reigns over
the constitution of the mind, and could by a single word of his
power make every companion abandon us, and every friend
look upon us with an altered countenance; that though I call
the house in which I live my own, and find in the endearments
of my family my repose and my happiness, it is God who gave
me my home, who spreads security around it, and fills it with
all its charities; that though my path in society be dignified by
the homage and civility of my acquaintances, it is God who
reigns in the human breast and administers all the delight of
social intercourse; that though my eye expatiates in rapture
on the landscape around us, it is the living God who beautifies
the scene, and gives it all its magnificence and all its glory;
in short, that everything we enjoy is a gift; that in whatever
quarter happiness is met with, a burden of obligation and dependence
lies upon us; that we have nothing which we did
not receive—that our all is suspended on God, and that to him
we owe all the praise, all the gratitude, all the obedience.
Now will any man who is acquainted with the movements of
his own breast, say that this praise and this obedience are
actually given? Are not the pleasures of life often tasted
without acknowledgment? Is not the conduct of life often
proceeded in without any reference to the will and authority
of him who is the author of it? Is not the mind in a state of
habitual estrangement from God, his existence absent from
our reflections, and his superintendency as a judge and as a
lawgiver absent from our principles? Go to whatever quarter
you please for happiness, there is no escaping the conclusion
that God is the giver of it, in his pervading energy which gives
effect and operation to all things. You can not fly out of his
presence, nor repair beyond the limits of his sovereignty.—<i>From
Dr. Chalmers.</i></p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<h3 id="JAN11">[<i>January 11.</i>]</h3>

<p>Of all the impossibles which ever were attempted, there is
none so wild and so irrational as to attempt an independence
upon God. It is in virtue of him that you are held together.
He measures out to you every moment of your existence. He
gives you not merely the air you breathe, but he gives you the
faculty of breathing. He provides for you not merely the external
goods which are scattered around you in such bounteous
profusion, but it is he who furnishes you with the capacity of
enjoying them. You talk of the pleasures of the world, and
fly to them as your refuge and your consolation against the
displeasure of an offended Deity, but think that it is only by a
continuance of his unmerited favor that you have these pleasures
to fly to. He can take them away from you; or, what perhaps
is a still more striking demonstration of his sovereignty,
he can make them no longer pleasures to you. He reigns
within as well as without you. To him you owe not merely
what is external, but to him you owe the taste and the faculty
which enjoys it. He can pervert these faculties. He can
change your pleasures into disgust. He can derange the constitution
of the inner man, and make you loathe as tasteless
and unsatisfying what you at present indulge in with delight
or look forward to with rapture. He is all in all. The whole of
our being hangs upon him, and there is no getting away from
his universal, from his ceaseless, from his unexcepted agency.
Now, do the Almighty the same justice that you would do to
an earthly benefactor; measure the extent of his claims upon
you by the extent of his benefits; think of the authority over
you which, as your Creator and as your constant preserver, he
has a right to exercise; think of your perpetual dependence,
and that all around you and within you, for every moment
and particle of your existence is upheld by God; and tell me,
if either in the thoughts of your hearts or in the actions of your
life you come up to the demand which his justice and his
authority have a title to prefer against you?—<i>From Dr. Chalmers.</i></p>

<p>What then, art thou, O, my God; what, I ask, but the Lord
God? For who is Lord but the Lord? or who is God save our
God? Most high, most excellent, most potent, most omnipotent,
most piteous and most just; most hidden and most near;
most beauteous and most strong; stable, yet contained of
none; unchangeable, yet changing all things; never new,
never old, making all things new, yet bringing old age upon
the proud, and they know it not; always working, yet ever at
rest; gathering, yet needing nothing; sustaining, pervading,
and protecting; creating, nourishing, and developing; seeking,
and yet possessing all things. Thou lovest, and burnest
not; art jealous, yet free from care; repentest, and hast no
sorrow; art angry, yet serene; changest thy ways, leaving unchanged
thy plans; recoverest what thou findest, having yet
never lost; art never in want, while thou rejoicest in gain;
never covetous, though requiring usury (Matt. xxv:27).…
Thou payest debts, while owing nothing; and when thou forgivest
debts, losest nothing. Yet, O my God, my life, my holy
joy, what is this that I have said? And what saith any man
when he speaks of thee? Yet woe to them that keep silence,
seeing that even those who say most are as dumb!</p>

<p>Oh! how shall I find rest in thee? Who will send thee into
my heart to inebriate it, so that I may forget my woes, and
embrace thee, my only good? What art thou to me? Have
compassion on me, that I may speak. What am I to thee, that
thou demandest my love, and unless I give it thee art angry
and threatenest me with great sorrows? Is it, then, a light
sorrow not to love thee? Alas! alas! tell me of thy compassion,
O Lord my God, what thou art to me: “Say unto my
soul, I am thy salvation.” So speak that I may hear. Behold
Lord, the ears of my heart are before thee; open thou them,
and “say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.” When I hear,
may I run and lay hold on thee. Hide not thy face from me.
Let me die, lest I die, if only I may see thy face.</p>

<p>Cramped is the dwelling of my soul; do thou expand it, that
thou mayest enter in. It is in ruins, restore thou it. There is
that about it which must offend thine eyes; I confess and know
it, but who will cleanse it? or to whom shall I cry but to thee?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Cleanse me from my secret sins, O Lord, and keep thy servant
from those of other men. I believe, and therefore do I speak;
Lord, thou knowest. Have I not confessed my transgressions
unto thee, O my God; and thou hast put away the iniquity of
my heart. I do not contend in judgment with thee, who art
the truth; and I would not deceive myself, lest my iniquity lie
against itself. I do not, therefore, contend in judgment with
thee, for “if thou, Lord, shouldst mark iniquities, O Lord, who
shall stand?”</p>

<p>O Lord God, grant thy peace unto us, for thou hast supplied
us with all things; the peace of rest, the peace of the Sabbath,
which hath no evening. For all this most beautiful order of
things, “very good” (all their courses being finished), is to
pass away, for in them there was morning and evening.</p>

<p>But the seventh day is without any evening, nor hath it any
setting, because thou hast sanctified it to an everlasting continuance;
that which thou didst after thy words, which were
very good, resting on the seventh day, although in unbroken
rest thou madest them, that the voice of thy Book may speak
beforehand unto us, that we also after our works (therefore
very good, because thou hast given them unto us) may repose in
thee, also in the Sabbath of eternal life.—<i>From St. Augustine.</i><a href="#sunday1" id="anch_sunday1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<h3 id="JAN25">[<i>January 25.</i>]</h3>

<p>Now tell me, Christians, have you hitherto understood it, and
do you still understand it, in this manner? Let each candidly
examine himself in the presence of God. Where is the ambitious
man, who, looking on his ambition as the wound of his
soul, desires in good earnest to be thoroughly cured? Where
is the voluptuous man, who, truly afflicted at his unhappy situation,
wishes efficaciously, and as his sovereign good, to be
freed from his passion? Where is the avaricious man, who,
ashamed of his injustice, sincerely and from his heart detests
his iniquity? Where is the woman, who, listening to religion,
hath a horror of vanity, and thinks of extirpating her self-love?
From what passion, from what vicious and ruling inclination
hath this divine Savior as yet delivered you? By
what, then, do you know him to be a Savior? And if he be a
Savior, by what mark do you pretend to know that he is yours?
What hath he by your own means performed in your regard?
Now, as I perceive that you are so ill disposed, should I not
prevaricate, did I declare to you his coming as a cause of joy?
And to speak as a faithful minister of the Gospel, ought I not
to tell you, what in fact I tell you? Undeceive yourselves, and
bewail your woeful situation, for, while enamored with the
world, you obstinately persist in such criminal dispositions,
though the Savior be born, no more advantage accrues to you
from his sacred birth, than if he were not born.…</p>

<p>… Hath this spirit of truth been hitherto a spirit of truth
for us?… Whatever profession we may make of being, as
Christians, the disciples of the spirit of truth, are we really
persuaded of the truths of Christianity? Hath he made us
relish them? Hath he given us a sincere and efficacious disposition
to put them in practice? We adore these divine truths
in speculation; but do we conform our conduct to them? We
speak of them perhaps with eloquence and enthusiasm; but
are our morals correspondent with our words? We give lessons
to others upon that head; but are we ourselves fully convinced
of them? Do we believe with a steadfast and lively
faith that, to be Christians, it is our duty not only to carry our
cross, but to place our glory in it? That, to follow Jesus
Christ, we must internally renounce not only all things, but
even ourselves? That, to belong to him, not only must we
not indulge the flesh, but must crucify it? That, to find grace
before God, we must not only forget injuries received, but return
good for evil? Do we firmly, and without hesitation, believe
all these points of the Evangelic doctrine? And can we
bear witness to ourselves that we believe them as fully and
constantly in heart as we openly confess them in words? The
Apostles, the moment they received the Holy Ghost, were
ready to lay down their lives for the truth; are we ready, I do
not say to lay down our lives but to destroy our irregular passions?
According to this rule, is there room to believe that
the spirit of truth hath undeceived us with respect to a thousand
errors which occasion all the misdeeds in the world?
That he hath disabused us of I know not how many maxims
which pervert us?… If he hath done nothing of all this,
what proof have we that we have received him? And if we
have not received him, whom have we to blame for it but ourselves?…
Preserve us from so great and fatal an irregularity,
O Divine Spirit! and, to that intent, make us know the
things thou didst teach the Apostles. Grant that at last we
may become truly thy disciples; and be to us not only a Spirit
of Truth, but a Spirit of Holiness.—<i>From Bourdaloue.</i><a href="#sunday2" id="anch_sunday2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.—PUBLIC LIFE OF THE GREEK CITIZEN.</h3>

<p>The aristocracy of the older Greek society was one based on
the exclusive owning of land, and of civic rights, and was not
marked by titles, but by the name of the clan. Thus at Athens
an Alcmæonid<a href="#greeklife1" id="anch_greeklife1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> was respected much as the member of an
old Scottish clan is now by his fellows. But poverty injured
the position of the old Greek more than that of the Scotchman.
In the aristocratic days all work in the way of trade or
business was despised by the landed gentry, and idleness was
called the sister of freedom. The pursuit of a trade often disqualified
a man for political rights, and in any case deprived
him of all public influence. This feeling did not die out even
in the complete democracies of later days, and there was
always a prejudice in the Greek mind against trades and handicrafts,
because they compelled men to sit at home and neglect
the proper training of the body by sports, and the mind by society.
Mercantile pursuits were also objected to by Greek gentlemen,
but on different grounds. It was considered that the
making of profits by retail trading was of the nature of cheating,
and the life of a merchant in any Greek city not his own
was always one of dependence and fear, for nowhere were
aliens treated with real justice and liberality. Thus even the
poor citizen of Athens, living by the small pay (nine cents
daily) given him for sitting on juries, and performing other
public duties, looked down with contempt upon the rich tradesman,
who was confined all day to a close dark shop, or still
worse, did his work in the hot atmosphere of a furnace. Consequently
the greater part of the shops in Athens, and most
of the trades were in the hands of licensed aliens who paid
certain taxes to the state, and by making large profits recouped<a href="#greeklife2" id="anch_greeklife2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
themselves for the risk of being persecuted and plundered
by the citizens in days of danger and distress. These
people may be compared, as to their social and political position,
with the Jews in the middle ages, who lived all through
the cities of Europe without civic rights, or landed property,
merely by trade and usury. They were despised and persecuted,
but still tolerated as useful, and even necessary, by the
governments of those days. Rich capitalists, on the contrary,
who were able to manage a large business through an overseer
and a number of slaves, were not at all despised, even
though their ways of making profits were sometimes very
shameful. But any free man who was compelled by poverty
to perform this manual labor was held little better than a slave.
There were certain privileged classes in Homer’s day, such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
the leech,<a href="#greeklife3" id="anch_greeklife3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> the seer, the bard, and the cunning worker of brass.
So in later days the sculptor and the sophist were in some respects
considered good society, but still the gaining of money
by giving up their time to others told very seriously against
them.</p>

<p>A great part of the ordinary clothing and breadstuffs was
prepared by the slave within the Greek house. The principal
tradesmen who supplied the other necessaries of life were the
architect, who was often a great and important person—indeed,
the only tradesman very honorably mentioned; under him masons,
carpenters, and cabinet-makers. There were potters,
who must have been a very large body, considering the great
demand for their wares, as neither glass nor wooden vessels
were much used. So there were separate makers of lamps,
jewelry, weapons of war, musical instruments. There were
a few weavers, and hardly any tailors—as the forms of dress
were perfectly simple, and the fashions did not change—but
many bleachers and dyers of clothes. The making of shoes
was even subdivided among several tradesmen. There were in
the market, cooks (hired by the day), ropemakers, tanners, and
also many perfumers and druggists. Tanners were generally
compelled to have their workshops outside the city. We may
also, without doubt, consider military service by sea or land
one of the ordinary trades of Greece, practiced from very
early times in Asia, and all through Greek history by the Arcadians,
who were the Swiss of the old world. The usual pay
for a mercenary soldier or sailor was four obols, which was
often raised in times of difficulty. When the former outlet which
enterprising young men had found in new colonies throughout
Asia Minor, Pontus, and Magna Græcia, was closed by the
rise of new races and new empires, this trade, disreputable as
it was, became very common indeed. The celebrated 10,000
whom Xenophon brought safely from the heart of the Persian
empire, were an army made up of these adventurers, who had
followed the younger Cyrus merely for the sake of pay and
plunder. Thus Agesilaus<a href="#greeklife4" id="anch_greeklife4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and Cleomenes, kings of Sparta,
were not ashamed to serve in Egypt as mercenaries.</p>

<h4>MERCANTILE PURSUITS.</h4>

<p>We may first notice the lower sort, the retail merchants,
who were employed in buying the husbandman’s and the
tradesman’s goods, and selling them in the markets or through
the towns at a profit. It was indeed much in fashion among
the Greeks, to sell one’s own produce in the market, but of
course such people as fishermen or shepherds could not leave
their business to journey often a long way to a market town.
Thus we find in large places like Athens, many butchers, fishmongers,
vegetable and other grocers, and particularly wine
sellers, who went about with their wine in carts. All these
people were accused of extortion and insolence, the fishmongers
of selling stale fish, the vintners of watering their wine
(a very harmless adulteration). There were street cries, and
often even the buyer going into the market called out what he
wanted.</p>

<p>The wholesale merchant was of course a more important
person, and the rise of this larger trade was in fact what raised
up a wealthy city class in opposition to the landed aristocracy,
and was generally the cause of overthrowing oligarchies.<a href="#greeklife5" id="anch_greeklife5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Many
respectable citizens (except in Sparta) thought it no disgrace to
follow this sort of business, and none of them scorned to invest
money in it as a speculation. As the land traffic in
Greece is unusually difficult and roundabout, almost all commerce
was carried on by sea, so that a merchant was often
called a skipper. We are fully informed about Athenian commerce
only.</p>

<p>We must imagine the Greek waters not as they are now,
lonely and desolate, with often not a single boat to give life to
a great bay or reach of water, but rather covered in the summer
with traffic and with life, so much so that a Greek poet speaks of
sailors as the “ants of the sea,” hurrying in all directions with
ceaseless industry. There were public wharves and warehouses
close to the quays, where the skipper brought samples
of his cargo. With the exception of the corn and slave factors,
the Greek merchants did not confine themselves to trading in
one kind of goods, but conveyed anything according as they
saw chances of profit. Pottery from Samos and Athens, fine
woolen stuffs and Assyrian carpets from Miletus, paper, unguents,
and glass from Egypt, salt fish, skins and corn from the
Black Sea, ship timber and slaves from Thrace and Macedonia,
ivory and spices from Cyrene<a href="#greeklife6" id="anch_greeklife6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>—these were among the
usual articles imported and exported through the Greek waters.
Merchants were in some places treated with peculiar favor, had
their taxes and military duty forgiven, and above all, were
granted a speedy trial, and in the idle winter months, in case
of disputes about contracts, or other lawsuits.</p>

<h4>WEIGHTS, MEASURES, AND COINAGE.</h4>

<p>All these great helps to trade were originally imported from
the Babylonians, through the Phœnicians into Greece, but with
so many variations that the computing of values according to
the different standards is very intricate.</p>

<p>As to measures of length, it seems that the Olympic stadium
or furlong was generally received through Greece. It was the
one-fortieth of our geographical mile, and was divided into
six plethra of one hundred feet each. Each foot, which was
nearly equal to our English foot, was divided into four hands,
and each of these into four inches.</p>

<p>Cubic measures started from the half pint, and were used for
both fluids and solids.</p>

<p>In these measures the Æginetan,<a href="#greeklife7" id="anch_greeklife7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Attic, and Olympic standards
varied. The latter, though originally brought from Babylon,
was somewhat smaller, the cubic foot being only two-thirds
of the Babylonian. To this Olympic cubic foot the Attic was
as twenty-seven to twenty, the Æginetan as nine to four. Similarly
as to weight, the Babylonians had fixed a cubic foot of
rain water as the standard weight of their talent. The Attic
talent was much smaller.</p>

<p>All the various talents, however, agreed in having sixty minæ;
each mina one hundred drachmæ; each drachme six
obols. The terms Æginetan and Eubœic point to the fact that
the early Greek trade was chiefly in the hands of these people,
where the weights and coinage were first fixed, just as the Attic
standard became almost universal afterward. The Attic
talent was about $1,180; the mina accordingly about $19.50;
the drachme nineteen cents; the obolus three cents. This
Attic drachme was of silver, which was the only metal habitually
coined for a long time in Greece, as gold was very scarce.
The Macedonian mines first produced gold enough for ordinary
coinage. So also copper coinage came in from Sicily
and Magna Græcia, where the talent was regarded as a weight
of copper, and only equal to six (or even less) Attic drachmæ.
There were at Athens silver pieces of four and eight drachmæ,
and even half and quarter obols. This shows how much
scarcer money was then than now, and how the public treasures
and private fortunes, which seem to us so small, were really
large in proportion to the prices paid even for the luxuries of
life.</p>

<p>Debasing the coinage, and using alloy, were common devices
among the Greeks, whose local coins seem seldom to
have had any general currency. It was specially noted of the
Attic money, that it passed everywhere, on account of its excellence.</p>

<h4>POLITICS.</h4>

<p>The general principle of Greek states was to consider
high political office as both a duty and an honor, but not a
profession, so that no salaries were attached to such duties. It
is certain, however, that the indirect profits were very great, inasmuch
as the bribery of that day was applied, not to the
electors, but to the holders of even very high office. This form
of corruption is said to exist even now in Greece, where bribery
of electors is very rare. The lower state officials, such as
secretaries and heralds, were paid moderate salaries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>When Athens became an imperial city, the sovereign people
were paid sundry emoluments from the taxes of their subjects.
For example, those Athenian citizens who were employed as
dicasts,<a href="#greeklife8" id="anch_greeklife8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> or judges in court, received three obols per day—an
income on which most of the poorer citizens lived. They were
also paid by public distribution a sufficient sum for their entrance
to the theater, and to enjoy themselves at the great festivals
of the city. These profits were the direct result of political
privileges.</p>

<p>As mercenary warfare was common, so that of mercenary
general was practiced, even by distinguished Greeks, such as
Agesilaus and Cleomenes, in later days. As the pay was only
four times that of the common soldier, it is evident that extortion
and plunder must have been presupposed as an additional
means of gain, and this was the case with many of the older
citizen generals of whom we read in history, such as Pausanias,
Themistocles, and others. The profession of military
engineer was not common, but was practiced with success and
fame by a few remarkable men, such as Artemon,<a href="#greeklife9" id="anch_greeklife9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> whose mechanical
genius made them very valuable.</p>

<h4>LAW.</h4>

<p>As men pleaded their own case among the Greeks, the
legal profession, as far as we know, could only give
friendly advice, or compose speeches for litigants, and this
was an extended and lucrative profession at Athens. In
some cases friends or supporters were allowed to speak in addition
to the actual litigants, but paid counsel were not directly
recognized. When the state retained what we should call a
public prosecutor, he was only paid one drachma (nineteen
cents) for a speech, which reminds us of a mediæval entry
quoted by Hallam, where eight cents and his dinner was a
lawyer’s fee. But distinguished orators like Demosthenes obtained
large private fees. There was also in almost all democracies
special encouragement, in the absence of state lawyers,
for any citizen to denounce any violation of the laws which
he could detect. This gave rise to a profession called sycophancy,
which usually degenerated into that of a spy or informer;
and such men constantly extracted money from rich
people and from politicians by threats of accusation.</p>

<h4>LITERATURE.</h4>

<p>In addition to the schoolmasters, who were not in high
repute, and were rather considered a trade than a profession,
there were the sophists, who were both rhetoricians
and philosophers, and who performed exactly the functions
now expected from universities, as distinguished from schools.
People spoke of a pupil of Isocrates as they now do of “a
Harvard man.” These men taught politics, rhetoric, literary
criticism, and higher science in a practical way, and made
large incomes in spite of their great unpopularity with the old-fashioned
side of both political and social Greece. At first
they obtained enormous fees, but by competition these were
reduced to an average of from five to ten minæ for a course of
instruction. Their course lasted about three years.</p>

<p>We do not hear of any authors making a livelihood by their
work, except poets, who were largely paid for occasional poems
by both states and kings, and whose dramatic works were
a source of profit as well as honor. Copies of books were
easily multiplied by means of slave labor, so that we hear of
Anaxagoras’<a href="#greeklife10" id="anch_greeklife10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> treatise being sold for one drachma, then very
dear. This was at a regular bookstall in Athens, from whence
books were actually an article of exportation as far as the
Black Sea. Still, collections of books were rare till after the
time of Euripides, and we know of no fortunes made by writing
books. Anaxagoras himself, though so popular with the
rising generation, is said to have died in poverty.</p>

<p>The profession of architects was esteemed far the greatest
among artists, and was the most richly paid. They were no
doubt men of culture, and were literary men, as, for example,
Ictinus,<a href="#greeklife11" id="anch_greeklife11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> one of the architects of the Parthenon, who wrote a
special work about the great temple. The professions of sculptor
and painter were not so at first, the sculptor being hardly
more than a skillful workman, and this seems to be the case
in most great art epochs. Men like Pheidias and Polygnotus,<a href="#greeklife12" id="anch_greeklife12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
who were of a higher level, often worked without accepting
any pay, but the sculptors who adorned the Erectheum at
Athens, one of the most beautiful of Greek temples, were
either paid by the day from one to two drachmæ, or by the
job, receiving two hundred to two hundred and forty drachmæ
(under $50) for each figure or small group of figures. This
was in Pericles’ time, when art had reached its highest perfection.</p>

<p>Similarly in music, though amateur singing and playing
were very common, it was not thought gentlemanly to live by
them, and professional musicians were ranked with actors and
jugglers, and the other classes who lived by amusing the rich.
At later periods, however, both celebrated musicians and celebrated
actors became important personages, and were courted
by a society which had abandoned higher and more serious
pursuits.</p>

<p>The medical profession had always a high position in Greek
life, from the days of Machaon Podalirius,<a href="#greeklife13" id="anch_greeklife13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> in Homer, down to
the doctors of Plato’s day, who sometimes brought an orator
with them to persuade the patient to take their remedies. This
was done because it was the fashion to discuss everything in
Greece, and people were not satisfied to submit silently to anybody’s
prescriptions.</p>

<p>There was of course a great deal of superstitious quackery,
which dealt in amulets and charms, and there were slave assistants,
who visited slave patients, but the higher members of
the profession were not only well paid, but appointed publicly
by the various cities as official physicians.</p>

<p>The most famous schools for medicine were at Croton, Cnidus,
Rhodes, and Cos, where the name of Hippocrates is celebrated
as the founder. These schools were guilds or trade
unions, into which the apprentice entered with a very remarkable
and solemn oath. Such accredited physicians were specially
exempted by law, in some cities, from prosecution for
manslaughter, if their patients died. The descriptions of the
symptoms and the treatment of various diseases still preserved
in the works attributed to Hippocrates, are so striking for their
good sense and acute observation, that the most competent
judges consider them the foundation of all rational medicine
in Europe.</p>

<p>In all the larger Greek towns the art collections were always
the main object of curiosity, which every one went to see.
There were the temples either venerable for age, or remarkable
for architectural splendor, and in them the statues of the
gods, and the portraits of heroes and victors which were the
work of famous sculptors. The inner walls of both temples
and porticoes were often covered with frescoes, and had even
separate pictures hung upon them. In fact, just as we now-a-days
go to see in such a town as Antwerp or Rouen the
churches, the pictures, the statues and carvings, and the antiquities,
so every educated Greek enjoyed the arts, and thought
his life incomplete without having seen their highest products.
Crowds went to see the Pheidian statue of Zeus at Olympia,
the Eros of Praxiteles at Thespiæ, the cow of Myron at Athens.
Such great works were constantly copied, and to this
practice we owe the inestimable benefit of finding in Roman
galleries close imitations of the Greek masterpieces brought
from Greece itself.</p>

<p>Each important state was indeed represented in considerable
cities by a proxenus, who corresponds to our modern consuls,
but of course he could not be expected to offer hospitality
to all travelers, though he did so to official visitors. Every
distinguished family had accordingly family friends in foreign
cities, to whom they were bound by mutual ties of hospitality.
These friendships were handed down from generation to generation,
and when the traveler had never seen his host he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
often brought with him a token formerly given to his family by
the family he went to visit. On his arrival the host gave him
a separate set of apartments, and supplied him with light, fuel
and salt; he also sent him his dinner the first day, and invited
him to dine afterward, but for the rest the guest was attended
by his own servants, and supplied himself. As to the actual
traveling, so much of it was done by sea that there seems to
have been but indifferent means of journeying on land. To
Delphi, Olympia, and such public resorts there were good
roads, which could be traveled in carriages, but elsewhere
pack mules and riding, or even walking was, as it now is,
the only way of crossing the country.</p>

<p>Athletic contests were always held conjointly with festivals,
so that we must separate two phases in the greatest and most
complex enjoyment of Greek society. In fact, the Greeks always
combined religion with sport. The greatest of these
meetings was undoubtedly that held at Olympia every five
years, and at which the victors were recorded since 776 B. C.
It was gradually thrown open to all Peloponnesians, then to all
European Greeks, and finally to all the colonies, in 620 B. C.
This extension was followed by the founding in rapid succession
of the public contests at Delphi (586), the Isthmos of Corinth
(582), and Nemea (576 B. C.). They were celebrated in
honor of the peculiar god honored at the place—Apollo at
Delphi, Poseidon at the Isthmus, Zeus at Nemea and Olympia.
There was a solemn truce declared throughout Greece during
the Olympic games, and all the world flocked thither to enjoy
the sports, meet their friends, transact mercantile or even political
business, and publish or advertise new works and new
inventions. At Delphi musical and poetical contests predominated,
but at the others the athletic elements.</p>

<p>In addition to athletic games, many musical and poetical
contests were encouraged at the festivals, as, for example, at
the Pythian games, held at Delphi, and at the Dionysia, held
at Athens. So much did these competitions come into fashion,
that the best advertisement and publication of a new poem, or
of a novelty in music, was its production on one of these occasions.
The great tragedies handed down to us were all composed
in this way, and brought out at Athens in honor of the
god Dionysus. For a fee of two obols, granted him by the
state, every citizen and his wife, at some contests even resident
strangers, could go and sit at the theater, and hear four
plays of Æschylus pitted against four plays of Sophocles, and
four of Euripides. The endurance of an audience not given
to reading, and not fond of staying at home, is of course much
greater than that of our modern play-going people.</p>

<h4>FESTIVALS.</h4>

<p>As the games and dramatic shows were in honor of the
gods, or sometimes in honor of deceased heroes, the real
celebration consisted in sacrifices, prayers, and solemn
processions. These sacrifices were combined with public
feasts, as a great many victims were slain. In all processions
the military, or citizens in armor, and on horseback, formed,
as they now do, an important and imposing part. But we are
bound to add that in addition to all the splendor of the festivals
and athletic contests, there was the usual collection of
mountebanks, jugglers, thimble-riggers, and other bad characters,
who now frequent horse races. This was so much the
case in later days, that Cicero indignantly denies the report
that he had gone to the Olympic games. On the other hand,
we must regard the home festivals in each Greek city among
the most humane and kindly institutions in their life. They
corresponded to our Sundays and holidays, when the hard-worked
and inferior classes are permitted to meet and enjoy
themselves. This was particularly the case with the slaves,
who enjoyed many indulgences on these special days. The
women also in such cities as usually insisted upon their seclusion,
were allowed to join in processions, and see something of
the world; and “the stranger that was within their gates,” or
who came to worship at the feast, was received with kindness
and hospitality. No executions or punishments were allowed;
prisoners were let out on bail, and the sentences of the law for
debts or fines were postponed in honor of the gods, who were
worshiped not in sadness, but with joy.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Hestia</span> (<span class="smcap">Vesta</span>).<a href="#greekmyth1" id="anch_greekmyth1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> In the domestic life of the Greeks Hestia,
the hearth goddess, occupied an important position. She was
one of the twelve great divinities, and her expressive symbol,
the fire, they carefully guarded and kept constantly burning.
In the more rude, barbaric state of society her worship was,
perhaps, not general, as there is no mention of her by Homer
in the “Iliad” or “Odyssey.” But as society advanced and the
importance of domestic order and purity was more fully recognized,
no other deity was held in greater veneration. She
gives security to the dwelling, and especially guards the virtue
and happiness of the family. “The hearth possessed among
the ancients a far higher significance than it does in modern
life. It served not only for the preparation of the daily meals,
but was esteemed the sacred altar in the house. There the
images of the Penates,<a href="#greekmyth2" id="anch_greekmyth2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> or household gods, were placed; and
then, after the old patriarchal fashion, the father and priest of
the family offered sacrifice on all important occasions of their
domestic life.” (Seemans.)</p>

<p>The well-ordered home, under the guardianship of the virgin
goddess, herself pure as the bright flame that was her symbol,
is the secure abode of happiness as complete as mortals know.
For the maintenance of its purity and peace the most solemn
vows were made and the tutelary<a href="#greekmyth3" id="anch_greekmyth3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> goddess invoked to avenge
the injured and reward the faithful. For those without, the
hearth itself was a sacred shrine before which suppliants, if
danger threatened, sought not in vain protection from the inhabitants
of the house. And, as the state is an extended family,
embracing all the domestic organizations in its domain,
Hestia, protectress of the home circle, regards also the interest
and safety of every civil community. So, thoughtful men of
upright character, their statesmen and wise senators, did not
hesitate to carry the religion of their homes into political matters
that engaged their best endeavors.</p>

<p>In the Greek states the senate house, or department of the
governing body, was solemnly dedicated to Hestia, and in it
they built her an altar, on which fire was kept ever burning.
That the daily sacrifice might not be wanting, or that sacred
fire ever become extinct, it was assiduously guarded by vestal<a href="#greekmyth4" id="anch_greekmyth4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
virgins, whose negligence would be severely punished.</p>

<p>The name Hestia is not only very sacred, but has a stem or
root meaning that indicates the fixed abiding position of her
altar in the room where the family dwelt, or the senators met
for business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hermes</span> (<span class="smcap">Mercury</span>). For the accredited pedigree, characteristics,
and exploits of this sly deity—things of much interest to
students of the old mythology—we are mostly indebted to
Homer and his imitators, the Rhapsodists, some of whose productions
were accepted as Homeric. He was the reputed son
of Zeus and the mountain nymph Maia, and born in a cave, or
grotto, on Mount Cyllene,<a href="#greekmyth5" id="anch_greekmyth5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> in Arcadia. The so-called “Homeric
Hymn,” assuming cunning and dexterity as his principal
characteristics, tells in a way to interest the reader, with
what amazing capacity his powers developed. Having such
a father, and his mother a daughter of Atlas, he grew as none
but gods can, almost instantly revealing his divine powers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Only a few hours after his birth he sprung from his mother’s
arms, or from the cradle where he lay, already planning an
expedition of vast proportions, and escaped from the grotto to
at once execute his purpose. On the way he met a beautiful
tortoise that he killed, and extracting the carcass from the
shell, stretched resonant cords across the cavity, and thus
made him a harp on which he played most skilfully. The
same day he hurried off to Pieria, where he stole fifty kine
from the herd of Apollo, and undertook to drive them to the
grotto of his mother. Fearing that the theft, so adroitly accomplished,
might be detected by their tracks in the sand, he
managed to drive them in such circuitous paths that, where
most exposed to observation, the tracks showed them to be
going toward the place from which they were stolen. His own
footsteps he disguised by wrapping his feet with tamarisk and
myrtle leaves. The next morning, at early dawn, he reached
the stream of Alpheus,<a href="#greekmyth6" id="anch_greekmyth6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and then rubbed sticks of wood
against each other till they were ignited. Thus Hermes is said
to have first given fire to mortal men. Another legend attributes
the same to Prometheus,<a href="#greekmyth7" id="anch_greekmyth7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> who is said to have stolen fire from
the altars of the gods. But this was kindled in the forest by
the friction of dry branches rubbed against each other by the
wind. In that forest Hermes slaughtered two of the herd, but,
though pressed with hunger, he ate none of the roasted meat.
After quenching the fire, and effacing all signs of it, he proceeded
to Cyllene, where he concealed the cattle, and, having
entered the place of his birth softly as a summer breeze, resumed
his place as a babe, and lay innocently playing with
the cradle clothes, while his right hand held the tortoise lyre
hidden under them. His absence and the booty with which
he returned were not unobserved by his mother, who chided
him for the theft, but was assured that, by such exploits, he
would secure for her and for himself admission to the assembly
of the gods. In the morning Apollo, missing part of his
herd, set out in search of them. An old man informed him
that a child was seen the day before driving cows along the
road. At Pylos he saw confused tracks of his cattle, but was
amazed at the strange footprints of the driver. Greatly chagrined
at his loss, and meditating chastisement for the thief,
he entered the cave of the nymph. Hermes, seeing him, gathered
himself under the clothes, feigning fear of the angry god.
Apollo searched all the premises for his stolen property to no
purpose. But convinced that the child, his own younger
brother was certainly guilty of the theft, he threatened to hurl
him into Tartarus<a href="#greekmyth8" id="anch_greekmyth8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> if he did not tell at once where the cows
were. The little fellow in his cradle, winking slyly, and making
a low whistling sound, as if amused at Apollo’s excitement,
denies any knowledge of the matter, and innocently asks what
cows are like. “I know nothing of cows,” he said, “but their
name. We must refer the matter to Zeus, who will decide
for us.”</p>

<p>When the father of gods and men heard the complaint and
the evidence, little Hermes, to the great amusement of the celestials,
stoutly denied the charge, and with his cradle clothes
about his person, argued the absurdity of supposing a mere
child like himself capable of such deeds.</p>

<p>Zeus admonished the contestants to be friends, but with a
significant nod, the suit was decided in Apollo’s favor, and the
brothers sent in quest of the missing kine. The miscreant led
the way, and when the cattle were brought out of the cave,
Apollo missed two, and was surprised to find their hides
stretched on a rock to dry—more so, that when attempting to
drive the others away their feet were found fastened in the
earth. Again he seized the offender for punishment, but he
in the emergency, thought of his lyre, and touching its chords,
called forth music so sweet and soothing that Apollo, forgetting
his anger, coveted the instrument and besought the musician
to teach him his wondrous art. “Take it,” said he,
“since you are wise, and will know how to use it well, but if
touched by those unskilled in the divine art, it will utter strange
nonsense, making uncertain, discordant moanings.” Delighted
with his acquisition, Apollo gave his brother a magic wand, by
which he could confer happiness on whom he would; and,
henceforth, they dwelt together in great harmony and love, the
honored sons of a common father.</p>

<p>Interpreting this myth one says, “while Apollo represents
the genial sunshine, Hermes, as a power of nature, is the rain—rain
and sunshine being both from the great God of heaven,
or, in the language of mythologists, his sons. They are both
beneficent and have many things so similar as to indicate a
common origin.”</p>

<p>In the process of time their conceptions of the younger
brother seem to have undergone some change, or possibly the
different shades of opinion may indicate the places rather than
the times in which they prevailed. To those who regarded
him as sending the fertilizing rain, and thus the dispenser of
manifold gifts, he also, and naturally, represented the wind
that “bloweth where it listeth,” and carries the clouds about
on their mission. This idea of personification may account
for some things in their legends that otherwise seem inexplicable.
Helpless infancy, in a very few hours leaving the cradle
and performing exploits the most astonishing, has its parallel
in the wind, which, at first only gentle zephyrs whispering
softly, soon may freshen to a gale, and in an hour sweep
over the earth with a force that defies resistance; and when
people make inquest for the mischief done they hear but the
mocking laugh as it hastens on, and the calm after a squall is
like the quiet return of the adventurous god to the cave and
cradle that were left for the exploits of that eventful day.
Then the clouds of various shape and color that are seen
grouped above the horizon, or scattered over the vast field of
the sky, were, to a vivid imagination, the herd of Phœbus, who
watches over them. When the rising wind, represented by
Hermes’ leaving the cave, carries them away, a stupendous
theft has been committed.</p>

<p>The offices of Hermes were many, and supposed to be useful,
nor was his many sided character thought bad when judged
by the moral code of a people who made him a god after their
own likeness. Crafty, dishonest merchants did not mean to
impeach his honesty when they implored him to give them
such shrewdness as to outwit and supplant others in the bargains
they made. Rogues and thieves prayed to him, just as
bandits and robbers in the same country and in parts of Italy
ask the patron saints to aid their assaults on defenseless travelers,
and give them a rich booty.</p>

<p>Arcadian shepherds invoked Hermes as the guardian of
flocks while he inspired their pastoral songs and directed in
the manufacture of the rustic instruments on which they
played.</p>

<p>Moreover, he was regarded and often spoken of as the fleet
messenger and dextrous agent of his father, Zeus. In this
character the epic poets most frequently present him. Swifter
than the wind he passes over the land and sea to execute
whatever commissions are intrusted to him. Once he destroyed
the hundred eyed Argus, the guardian of Io, on which
account he is called by Homer the Argus slayer.</p>

<p>Seemans suggests that Argus in that myth represents the
starry heavens, and the suggestion is plausible—Argus is slain
by the rain god; that is, the stars are hid by the thick clouds.</p>

<p>As represented in art, he bears the herald’s staff, or wand,
given him by Apollo, by the means of which he can induce
sleep or rouse the slumberer; but it was supposed to be used
chiefly in guiding souls to their abodes in the under world.
The earliest Greeks, as indeed men of all nations, and in
every state of society, civilized, semi-civilized or savage, cherished
the expectation of a state after death, and though vaguely
hoping for happiness hereafter, they also felt the need of an
escort, though unseen, to that “land of deepest shade unpierced
by human thought.” The belief in Hermes as psychopompus,<a href="#greekmyth9" id="anch_greekmyth9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
or conductor of the soul, doubtless gave the dying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
mythologist when consciously loosing his hold on things visible
and tangible, some crumbs of comfort. With no other rod
or staff on which to lean, a heathen poet could say:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“<i>Non ego omnis moriar.</i>”<a href="#greekmyth10" id="anch_greekmyth10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">Such was at least the longing for immortality in the darkest
ages.</p>

<p>The statues and plastic representations of Hermes, as also
of the other divinities, changed with the progress of this ideal
development. They represent him as a shepherd, sometimes
a herald, or messenger, and always as a powerful, bearded
man. Those of later date show him as a beardless youth, but
of great strength, with broad chest, lithe but powerful limbs,
curly hair, small mouth and eyes, a wonderful combination of
grace and vigor. “If we add to this the expression of kindly
benevolence which plays around his finely cut lips, and the
inquiring look of his face as he bends forward thoughtfully, we
have the principal characteristic features artists have given of
this god.” Of existing statues, in bronze and marble, we can
not speak more particularly—such are found in the Vatican, at
Naples, and in the British Museum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hades.</span>—This name now, and from the beginning of the
Christian era, used only to distinguish a place, was in mythology
a personal appellative, and given to one of the Olympic
divinities who received, by allotment, control of the lower
world. He was son of Cronos and Rhea, and there are but few
legends of him that the reader would care to see recorded, on
account of the mysterious gloom that enveloped his person and
his kingdom. It is enough to say he was at first regarded with
dread as the unpitying, unrelenting foe of mankind, and while
all were fated in their appointed time to descend to his dismal
realms, heedless of their mortal reluctance and agony, he
gathered them in, and deaf to their prayers kept his gate so
guarded by that hundred headed monster Cerberus<a href="#greekmyth11" id="anch_greekmyth11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> that none
could ever escape. The conception was so horrible that men
shrank from it in dismay. Hades, being inexorable, was not
worshiped. Prayer had no encouragement, no utterance.
Those who dreaded to become his victims might wail in their
agony or curse bitterly, but no door of hope was open for
them.</p>

<p>In the course of time—how long none can tell, as no details
are given, but in after ages—the Greek conception of Hades as
a divinity seemed to undergo considerable change. Not only
other but very different characteristics were given to him. He
even received a new name, Pluton (riches), possibly indicating
for him some agency in sending up, from the bosom of the
earth, nourishment for things that grow on its surface, and also
as offering unbounded wealth to mankind in the metals whose
mines are in the subterranean chambers. But though the
original dismal conception of this stern, inexorable deity was
partially relieved, mention of him seems always to have conveyed
to the mind the idea of something grim and painfully
mysterious, and that probably caused them to speak of him
but seldom, and with fear.</p>

<p>We are more interested to trace their notions of the underworld
itself, and respecting the state of the dead who have entered
it. On these subjects there was evidently some diversity
of opinion, not between different persons only, but of the same
person at different times. Even Homer presents two distinct
views respecting the abode and condition of the dead. In the
“Iliad” he locates it beneath the flat earth, and not far from the
upper surface. Describing the battle of the gods he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Pluto, the infernal monarch, heard alarmed,</div>
<div class="verse i1">And, springing from his throne, cried out in fear,</div>
<div class="verse i1">Lest Neptune breaking through the solid earth</div>
<div class="verse i1">To mortals and immortals should lay bare</div>
<div class="verse i1">The dark and drear abode of gods abhorred.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But in the “Odyssey,” the realm in which the shades of the
departed wander, lies far west of the earth-girdling Oceanus,
or is an island in the midst of that fabled stream. Nor is this
at all wonderful, since, after the progress of centuries, and the
partial unveiling of the future in the divine oracles, the <i>heaven</i>
revealed, as to its latitude, longitude and topography, remains,
even to Christians, a <i>terra incognita</i>.<a href="#greekmyth12" id="anch_greekmyth12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>In the profoundly interesting problem of a future life the
question of locality is of little importance. That which more
concerns the mortal, yet immortal man, is what that life shall
be; and, in their answers to that question, theology and mythology
differ widely. The latter claims for departed spirits
only a shadowy, dreamy, dismal existence, devoid of any real
happiness. At first they seem to have had no thought of any
difference in their allotments, and say nothing of the judgment
of the dead. Further on in their history the idea of future
reward and punishment had some development. Thenceforward
there was a division in Pluto’s realm, and the nethermost
part was called Tartarus, a deep, dark, cavernous abode
of wretchedness and woe, where those condemned by the
judges,<a href="#greekmyth13" id="anch_greekmyth13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Minos, Rhadamanthus and Æacus were tormented
by the Furies. The good, being special favorites of the gods,
are transferred to elysian fields—isles of the blessed—and find
their happiness complete, while those of a middle class,
without either positive excellence or damning wrong, are permitted
to remain in a dusky region, where, as dim but ghastly
shades, they pass a dull, joyless existence, without much positive
suffering.</p>

<p>The punishment of great criminals was a fruitful theme for
the imaginations and pens of the Greek poets. Tityus, who
had offered violence to Leto, is chained to the earth while
vultures constantly tear his ever growing liver. Tantalus,<a href="#greekmyth14" id="anch_greekmyth14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
who had been admitted to the table of the gods, but impiously
thought to test their superior discernment by putting before
them the flesh of his son Pelops, is for his crime doomed to suffer
the torments of continual hunger and thirst. Just above his
head are branches laden with beautiful and luscious fruits, but
when he attempts to pluck them a gust of wind bears them
quite beyond his reach. He stands on the bank of a beautiful
stream clear as crystal, or in the midst of the water, but
when he attempts to quench his raging thirst it is impossible
even to wet his lips. Sisyphus, once king of Corinth, and a
great sinner, was condemned to roll a block of stone up a
high mountain, but, soon as the top was reached, the huge
stone, by some sudden impulse, rolled back to the plain, and
with weary limbs he must continue the fruitless struggle.
Ixion, also an insolent offender, is chained, hands and feet,
to an ever revolving wheel and tortured without respite or hope
of release. And the daughters of Danaus, who at their father’s
bidding had slain their husbands the night of their nuptials,
are laboriously pouring water into a perforated cask with
despair of ever accomplishing the required task of filling it.
The punishment was deemed retributory, and in these examplary
cases from its nature without end.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eros and Psyche</span><a href="#greekmyth15" id="anch_greekmyth15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> (<span class="smcap">Cupid and the soul</span>).—Eros, reputed
a son of Aphrodite and Ares, in the earlier legends appears a
winged child; then a boy of marvelous beauty on the verge of
youth, but small of stature. His characteristic is the golden
bow, from whose taut string arrows fly to their mark, with
unerring aim, and inflict wounds that represent the consuming
pangs of love. As the charming but mischief-making Eros,
being solitary, did not grow, his mother, by the advice of
Artemis, gave him as a play-fellow a brother whom they
named Anteros; his company caused content and happiness.
Eros was venerated not only as the god of love, kindly influencing
the sexes toward each other, and kindling purest fires
on their home altars, but as the author also of loving friendships
between youths and men. For this reason probably, his
statue was placed between those of Hermes and Hercules in
the gymnasia, and the warlike Spartans sacrifice to him before
battle, pledging themselves to be faithful, and stand by
one another in time of need.</p>

<p>The significant myth showing the love of Eros for Psyche is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
of more recent origin and shows some higher religious notions.
Various interpretations of the legend have been suggested, all
of them sufficiently fanciful. We give here an abridgment
of a much lengthier account found in “Stories from the
Classics.”</p>

<p>In a certain city were three daughters of the king, of whom
the youngest, Psyche, being exceedingly beautiful, was
thought the loveliest of mortals. Her enraptured admirers
built altars for her worship as a goddess, and strewed them
with flowery garlands. The charming Psyche was too gentle
and good to be elated by the homage, however extravagantly
expressed, but the hearts of her less beautiful sisters were soon
filled with envy and jealousy. Moreover Venus herself, the
goddess of beauty, became like a mortal jealous of poor
Psyche. Highly offended that her own altars should be neglected
for those of an earth-born maiden, she retired in anger
to her favorite isle, and there cherished purposes of revenge.
Thither her winged boy, Cupid, came quickly at his mother’s
call. With tears and many passionate lamentations she told
him the story of her wrongs—how Psyche was honored and
Venus neglected. “You alone, my son,” she said, “can punish
this presumptuous beauty, and make her feel that it is a
serious thing to incur the displeasure of the immortals.” When
her plans were made known, soothing his mother with fond
caresses, Cupid readily promised to execute all her wishes.
Then, in obedience to her commands, he hastened away to a
luxuriant island in the midst of the ocean, where were two
fountains side by side, one clear as crystal, imparting health
and happiness to all who drank of the delicious water; the
other turbid and of a most deadly nature. Those who tasted
its poisoned water were never happy again. From the one, a
living fountain, he took water of joy, from the other of sorrow,
and placing each in a little amber urn, flew away to the palace
of Psyche, where he found her lying upon a couch, fragrant
with roses, asleep, and smiling in her pleasant dreams. Too
intent on accomplishing his mission to be deterred, even by
the sight of such transcendent beauty, silently and lightly as
falls a noxious dew upon a gentle flower he shed on her
slightly parted lips the fatal drops of grief, and was preparing
to wound her with his arrow, when his victim suddenly awoke.
The scene was changed and the mischievous, cruel Cupid was
now quite overcome with her strange loveliness, and the gentle
expression of her lustrous eyes. Filled with remorse for
what was done he hastily shed on her golden ringlets the
balmy drops of joy, intended for another, and vanished from
her sight.</p>

<p>The father of Psyche fearing the wrath of the celestials on
account of the adoration paid to his daughter, inquired, at the
oracle of Apollo, what course he should pursue. The response
filled him with anguish. He was directed to place the maiden
on a barren rock on the top of the mountain, and there abandon
her to her unknown fate. The poor king and his queen
wept much, but dared not disobey the oracle, cruel as it
seemed. Preparations were made in sadness, and on the day
appointed Psyche was attended to the destined rock by a
mournful procession of friends whose lamentations rent the
air. When the broken-hearted parents bade a last adieu to
their beloved child, they ordered the gates of their palace to
be shut and gave themselves up to despair. As the train of
mourners gradually disappeared Psyche stood trembling on the
top of the lone mountain, and now overcome with grief and
fear, she burst into tears, bemoaning her sad condition. Then
the gently blowing zephyr caught and raised her in the air, and
bearing her over the valley at the foot of the mountain left her
on a flowery turf, in a sweet sleep. When she awoke all fear
was gone. Looking around she saw, near a grove of lofty
trees, a cool fountain gently flowing, and within the grove a
palace so gorgeous that it was evidently the residence of a god.
It was of costly materials, exquisite workmanship, and filled
with immense treasures, all of which seemed secure without
guards or doors. As the astonished but now delighted maiden
entered, a voice of angelic sweetness addressed her, saying,
“Lovely Psyche, all these treasures are yours, and we whose
voices you hear, though invisible, are your servants, who will
obey all your commands. Come to the banquet already prepared
for our rightful mistress.” She was conducted to a rich
repast of ambrosia and nectar, served by invisible hands, and
entertained with delightful music from Æolian harps.</p>

<p>Psyche did not know who the lord of the palace was, but,
without being suffered to behold him, she became his wife, and
lived for a long time contented and happy; treated by him,
when present, with the utmost kindness, and, in his absence,
cheered by the voices of her unseen attendants.</p>

<p>When her sisters, wicked women, who had heard of her happiness,
and were invited to share it, arrived at the palace they
were received by Psyche most cordially. She tenderly embraced
them, showed them her treasures, and bestowed such
gifts as sisterly affection suggested. But their hearts were hard
and cruel. More envious than before at the sight of such
magnificence, they artfully planned to destroy their unsuspecting
victim, who had been warned not to allow any idle curiosity
about her husband, lest, by so doing, she might lose him
forever. “Dearest sister,” they say, concealing their real
feelings under a mask of sisterly kindness, “our love constrains
us to make known to you that the being you call your
husband is doubtless some malignant spirit who dares not
show to you his hideous person, and who will some day destroy
you. Take therefore, we entreat, this lamp and dagger; conceal
the lamp in the tapestry of your chamber, and in the night
satisfy your curiosity. If he prove the monster we suspect,
you can kill him in his sleep and return to the home of your
distracted parents.”</p>

<p>Poor Psyche was overwhelmed with sorrow, and after much
talking they so wrought on both her fear and curiosity that she
reluctantly promised to heed their advice. As night approached
her courage failed, and all the past kindness of her
husband coming in mind made her design appear most ungrateful,
yet she must keep her promise, and at any risk, satisfy
the doubts that were distracting her. So when all voices
were hushed, the lights out, and deep silence reigned in the
palace, she took the lamp from the place where she had concealed
it, and, with trembling, drew near the couch where she
saw her husband lying fast asleep. What was her glad surprise
when she found him none other than the beautiful god
Cupid himself. His countenance was so radiant that the very
light of the revealing lamp seemed to grow dim. On his
shoulders were wings of delicate whiteness, covered with a
tremulous down. His bow and arrows lay at his feet. As she
stood over him, entranced by the sight, the oil in the lamp, as
if to punish her crime, bubbled over and the burning liquid
fell on the shoulder of the sleeper. Immediately he started
up, and looking reproaches stronger than words, at once flew
away in silence. Alas! for the imprudent wife’s distress,
when the husband she adored left her in anger, and, as she
feared, never to return.</p>

<p>The deceitful sisters, themselves deceived by a false tale of
Cupid’s regard for them, miserably perished. When the indignant
Venus learned that Cupid, instead of punishing, had
taken to his palace her detested rival, and then suffered injury
at her hand, she threatened vengeance and sent Mercury in
search of the object of her hate. Her wounded son was cared
for, but not without upbraiding him for his conduct, and proposing
such chastisement as anger mingling with maternal
love suggested.</p>

<p>As for the deserted Psyche, having attempted in vain to
drown herself in a neighboring stream, she wanders through
the world in search of her lost love. Relentlessly persecuted
by her adversary, who subjected her to numerous and severe
trials, the plants and animals, the reed, the swan, the eagle,
offer advice and assistance. Pitied, but unaided, unprotected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
by the higher goddesses, Ceres and Juno, her case becomes
desperate, and she determines, at once, to surrender herself
into the hands of Venus. “Possibly she may be won by my
good and dutiful conduct, and in the house of his mother I
may get a sight of him I have so long sought in vain.” That
hope, too, was doomed to disappointment. The haughty goddess,
forgetting alike the dignity of her rank, and the tenderness
of a mother, spoke bitter, revengeful words, and, calling
two servants, Sorrow and Solicitude, she ordered them to chastise
her in the severest manner. The suffering of her victim
did not satisfy the angry Venus, and the most difficult tasks were
enjoined. Having tried her ability by requiring many things
thought impossible for mortals, but that were all, by the aid of
favoring divinities, accomplished, as a last effort she bade her
go to the palace of Pluto, in the infernal regions, and, carrying
a box given her for the purpose, to request of Proserpine<a href="#greekmyth16" id="anch_greekmyth16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
a portion of her divine beauty, and bring back the treasure
untouched. It was a perilous undertaking; but again helped
and instructed how to proceed, it was accomplished in safety,
and with entire success. She escaped the wiles with which
Proserpine sought to detain her guest, and obtained the treasure
box, filled and carefully closed. In her instructions she
was enjoined not, on any account, to open the box or meddle
with its precious contents. When returning, the chief difficulties
and dangers of the way already past, her woman’s curiosity
again prevails, and silencing her fears and her conscience, she
decides to appropriate a very small portion of its contents, desiring
to become more pleasing to her offended husband, whom
she still hopes to meet. The lid was cautiously raised, when
lo! instead of the celestial beauty that was expected, there
issued from within, a black, dense vapor which enveloped her
so closely, that, presently, overcome with a deep stupor, she
fell senseless to the ground.</p>

<p>Cupid having escaped from the palace, and, having on his
downy wings, witnessed the whole of this proceeding, flew
to the spot, and, quickly gathering up the deadly vapor, confined
it again within the casket. Then gently arousing the
stupefied Psyche, with a touch of his arrow, “See,” said he,
“how thou wouldst perish by this foolish curiosity! Arise now
and complete the task imposed by my mother, while I supplicate
the mighty Jupiter to appease her anger.” Thus saying
he soared on high, nor ceased his flight till he reached Olympus,
the lofty dwelling of the gods. Then kneeling before the
throne he pleaded with such eloquence the cause of his hapless
spouse that the king of gods was moved to pity, and promised,
by the exercise of his sovereign will, to end forever
Psyche’s misfortunes and sufferings. Mercury was ordered to
conduct her to his presence, and, eager to fulfill so pleasant a
commission, the winged messenger darted through the air with
utmost speed and soon returned with his charge.</p>

<p>The joy of Cupid was boundless, when Psyche, more lovely
than ever, stood by his side. Jupiter, regarding her for a time
with silent admiration, then, presenting a cup of nectar, said:
“Take this, and be henceforth immortal. The bitter waters
that have occasioned all your sufferings, after this divine
draught will be forgotten. Venus shall no longer mourn your
union with her son. It has the approval of the gods, and
shall endure forever.”</p>

<p>Psyche thus indued with a new and glorious nature, looked
imploringly at mother Venus. Friendly influences stealing
into her heart, the goddess yielded, and embraced her radiant
daughter with maternal affection. The wedding banquet was
prepared, and the Hours with roseate fingers decked the bride.
Ganymede,<a href="#greekmyth17" id="anch_greekmyth17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> as commanded, poured for them the sparkling
nectar, and cloud-capped Olympus echoed to the glad sounds
of choral voices.</p>

<p>Neptune came from his ocean cave; Apollo and the Muses
were attracted by the sweet notes of song; Minerva laid aside
her helmet to grace the marriage feast with her presence;
Mars, with swordless hand, and merry Bacchus, the grape
wreath that bound his golden hair nodding as he stepped, all
joined the festive company. The Graces had decorated the
spacious hall; there were thrilling strains of music in the orchestra,
and Venus herself danced for joy. Psyche, the admired
of all, reclining on the bosom of her reconciled husband,
in the bliss of so divine a union lost forever the remembrance
of all her sorrows.</p>

<p>This beautiful fable, some say, represents the trials and destiny
of human beings. The soul—so the mythologists held—though
of divine origin, is here subjected to error and evil in
its prison, the body. Trials and purifications are necessary,
that it may become capable of purer pleasures and nobler aspirations.
Two loves meet it, one earthly and degrading, the
other heavenly and elevating. This, when victorious leads off
the soul, disenthralled and purified, to the abodes of the blessed.</p>

<p>According to these expositors the myth is a moral one, and
represents the dangers to which nuptial fidelity was exposed in
such a country as degenerate Greece, and also gives an instance
of true constancy subjected to many and strong temptations,
but victorious over them all.</p>

<p>As allegorical myths are of doubtful interpretation, the
reader may escape some perplexity by accepting the story as a
tale of fancy, intended for innocent amusement, rather than
for instruction in psychology or morals.</p>

<h3>IV. APPLES, PEACHES, BLACKBERRIES AND STRAWBERRIES.</h3>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">BY BYRON D. HALSTED, SC. D.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>In our study of the food products of the earth, we now come
to a consideration of some of our leading fruits. All of the
four given above are furnished us by a single order of plants,
namely: the Rose Family, or <i>Rosaceæ</i>.<a href="#kitchen1" id="anch_kitchen1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> This order not only
contains the “Queen of Flowers,” but the “King of Fruits;”
it is, in short, a royal family among plants, without which we
should be deprived of much that is very beautiful, and more
that is exceedingly useful. We are dependent upon the cereals
for our flour, but what would flour be without some fruit to
mix with it in the formation of a very long list of our most
highly prized viands? Apple pies, peach dumplings, blackberry
puddings and strawberry shortcakes all have their ardent
admirers, and happy is the housewife who can make them
to perfection.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Apple.</span>—Well might the apple be the fruit to tempt
mankind. The schoolboy feels this when before him stands a
neighbor’s tree loaded with the golden spheres of ripeness and
sweetness. Well might Solomon with all his wisdom acknowledge
the beauty and worth of this best of fruits when he writes:
“A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver.”
Downing, in his classic work on “The Fruits and Fruit
Trees of America” says: “Among the heathen gods of the
north there were apples fabled to possess the power of conferring
immortality, which were carefully watched over by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
goddess Iduna,<a href="#kitchen2" id="anch_kitchen2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and kept for the special dessert of the gods
who felt themselves growing old.” Apples may not confer
immortality, but they lend new charms to life, and we should
guard this fruit as did the sleepless dragon the golden apples
in the orchards of Hesperus.<a href="#kitchen3" id="anch_kitchen3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>If the “tree of knowledge” is not an allegory, and it bore
apples, we have the antiquity as well as ancient edibility of the
apple at once established. The origin and first home of the
apple, like all the fruits, flowers and vegetables in cultivation
before the time of human records, is all obscurity, and speculation
has free course in seeking for the early history of the
apple. This fruit was extensively cultivated by the Romans,
and is widely diffused through all parts of the temperate zone.</p>

<p>The apple tree is one of slow growth and medium size,
though there are some specimens in this country of great dimensions.
The head is low-spreading, and the flowers sweet
and beautiful. The blossom, as well as the fruit that follows
it, is famous in story and in song. The kinds of apples are
very numerous, and the number is increasing every year. The
genus <i>Pyrus</i>,<a href="#kitchen4" id="anch_kitchen4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> to which the common apple belongs, has several
species, including the mountain ashes, common chokeberry,
and several kinds of crab apples, and last, but far from the
least, the pears. The orchard apple is thus seen to be in the
midst of good company.</p>

<p>Apples are classified in various ways; that by J. J. Thomas,
in his “American Fruit Culturist,” is as follows: Three divisions
are made upon the time of ripening—as, summer, autumn,
and winter apples. Under each of these are two classes,
namely: sweet apples, and those with more or less acidity.
Under each of these six classes are two sections, viz.: color
striped with red—color unstriped. The three points in this
classification are season, taste, and color of skin. For example,
the apple before me is a summer fruit, sweet, with skin not
striped. It belongs in the second section of class one of the
first division. It is the sweet bough. Again, the apple is striped,
acid, and winter; by referring to the descriptive list we find it
is northern spy, king of Tompkins, or Wagener. The characteristics
of the groupings above given are not properly distinct.
As Thomas says: “Summer apples gradually pass into autumn,
and autumn into winter apples. A few … possess
nearly a neutral flavor between a dead sweetness and
slight acidity. Again, apples classed with those that are
striped, sometimes present a nearly uniform shade of red.” So
much interwoven are the colors, periods of ripening, etc., that
Downing discards all classification and arranges his descriptive
list alphabetically. In describing apples and similar fruit
the word <i>base</i> is used for the stem end of the fruit, and <i>apex</i>
the blossom end. The primary forms of apples are: oblate,
roundish, conical, and oblong. The last report of the American
Pomological Society<a href="#kitchen5" id="anch_kitchen5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> catalogues three hundred and thirty-seven
varieties of apples, with the standing of each in the several
states and territories. From this tabulation we select the
following varieties as among those that proved the best: For
summer, early harvest, red astrachan, sweet bough, American
summer, Carolina June, and Oldenburg; for autumn, fall pippins,
Porter, maiden’s blush, Gravenstein, late strawberry, sops
of wine, and primate; for winter, Baldwin, Ben Davis, Hubbardston,
Rhode Island greening, northern spy, and farmer’s. These
sorts are not equally good everywhere, but taken all in all they
are among the leading sorts. There may be some varieties of
only local reputation that do better in their native section than
any here mentioned. Some apples are adapted to the warmer
climate of the southern states, while others are suited to the cold
regions farther north. The wealthy apple is a fine illustration
of the latter; it is especially suited to New Hampshire, Wisconsin,
Minnesota, Iowa and Colorado.</p>

<p>Apple trees are raised from seed sown in autumn, and remain
in the seed bed for two or three years, when they are removed
in the spring, with their tap-root or main root cut to
the nursery rows. The following autumn they are budded with
the desired variety. The well ripened bud is inserted in the
bark of the twig, near the ground. The growth from the bud
afterward forms the tree top. The trees may be set in the
orchard the third year after budding. The soil best adapted
for an orchard is a strong loam containing abundant limestone
or calcareous matter. The soil should be kept mellow by frequent
cultivation, until the trees are of considerable size. It
must be remembered that the trees are of first importance, and
they should not be starved by lack of richness in the soil or by
the growth of exhausting grain crops.</p>

<p>There are many insect enemies to the apple tree, the leading
among which are the borers, American tent caterpillar, canker
worm, bark-lice and codling moth. The methods of treating
each one of these pests have been well worked out, but space
forbids our giving them in this connection.</p>

<p>It is important that apples be gathered with care, especially
if to be sent to market. The reputation of American apples
in the English market has suffered greatly from carelessness
in picking and packing. Fruit sells more by appearance
than anything else, and therefore the packages should be neat
and the contents uniformly good. Apples are employed in
various ways beside cooking. They are the source of much cider
that afterward by fermentation forms the best quality of
vinegar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Peach.</span>—The peach (<i>Prunus Persica</i><a href="#kitchen6" id="anch_kitchen6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>) is a native of
Persia, as the botanical name indicates, and was brought from
that country to Italy by the Romans. It is frequently mentioned
by ancient writers, and was regarded with much veneration
by the people of Asia. The peach reached the British
Isles in the sixteenth century. There is no country where the
peach is more successfully grown than in some portions of the
United States. It can not be grown with profit north of 42°
north latitude, but south of this line it flourishes as far as the
Gulf of Mexico. There are some localities specially adapted
for the peach, and here it is grown in its perfection. First
among such sections is the Delaware peninsula, a territory of
six thousand square miles, within which more peaches per acre
are produced than anywhere else on the globe, and of the
finest quality. A portion of Michigan, known as the “peach
belt,” is likewise famous, and supplies the western markets
with vast quantities of this luscious fruit.</p>

<p>The peach is a small tree, with long narrow leaves and
beautiful pink blossoms. It grows rapidly to maturity, and
after bearing a few crops is through with its best work, and
should be replaced by another.</p>

<p>Mr. Fulton, in his small book on “Peach Culture,” writes:
“The seed should be of natural fruit. It is more vigorous,
more hardy, more certain to germinate, and the tree lives longer.
This should never be overlooked by any planter who
wishes the full reward of his labors.” This indicates that the
seed in the budded fruit loses some of its vitality. It is doubtless
a law that as we go farther from the native or wild state
the less vigorous becomes the nurtured plant. The artificial
life that many plants lead leaves them no time to store up
strength for the continuation of the race, and in many cases
they have lost all power of producing offspring. The young
peach trees are provided by sowing the seeds in beds, carefully
kept free from weeds. After the proper size is reached,
buds are inserted, as above mentioned under the apple, and
in a year or two the budded trees are ready for the orchard.</p>

<p>This process of budding is similar to that of making cuttings
or slips, only, a single bud is set in the cleft bark of a living
stem, instead of a piece of branch, with two or more buds,
set in moist sand. Grafting differs from budding in that the
cion is a stem with two or more buds, usually set in a cleft of
a living branch; it is budding on a larger scale, and is suited to
large trees.</p>

<p>The varieties of peaches are very numerous, more than one
hundred and fifty sorts being set down in some lists. It is not
an easy task to select the best. There are many things to consider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
in deciding upon the merit of a peach. It may have the
best flavor, but be subject to rot, a poor bearer, or be so small
that it will not sell well. The tree should be vigorous and productive,
with fruit large, rich flavored, and fine colored. Such
fruit is fit food for the gods. From the recent Pomological Society
catalogue we find that the following varieties are the most
in favor, take the whole country through. Among those known
as very early are: Alexander, early York, large early York,
Hales and truth; medium, early Crawford, Chinese cling, Columbia,
oldmixon free and oldmixon cling; late, smock, stump-the-world,
late Crawford, Heath cling, and Ward’s late. By a
careful selection of varieties with regard to their time of ripening,
a small orchard would furnish fruit from midsummer until
the frosts come. In setting out an orchard there is a tendency
to purchase new sorts, and for this the nurserymen are largely
to blame. A man’s interest in the sale of so simple a thing as
a tree may cause it to be overestimated. A half dozen time-tested
standard sorts are worth more than a score of new seedlings
without any record.</p>

<p>Peaches are classified by their fruit into those with white
flesh and yellow flesh, and these are divided again into free-stones
and clings. In some of the clings the flesh is very superior,
but owing to its close union with the stone it is difficult
to eat, and therefore is far less popular than free-stones of an
inferior quality.</p>

<p>The leading enemies to the peach are the borer, curculio,<a href="#kitchen7" id="anch_kitchen7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
the leaf-curl and the “yellows.” The “curl” is caused by a
fungus, and the remedy is picking and burning the leaves.
The “yellows” is the most fatal of all the enemies, having
ruined hundreds of the finest orchards. The cause is not fully
understood, but the indications are that it may be a low form of
microscopic life known as bacteria. No cure has been found,
and when a tree turns the characteristic yellow it should be
torn out and burned, root and branch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackberries.</span>—The two fruits already described in this
paper are of a comparatively large size, and grow on trees.
We now come to the so-called “small fruits,” among which
are the blackberry, raspberry, strawberry, currant, and gooseberry.
The genus <i>Rubus</i><a href="#kitchen8" id="anch_kitchen8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> furnishes both the blackberries and
the raspberries, thus showing that these two kinds of small
fruits are very closely related. There are about one hundred
and fifty species of blackberries scattered throughout the
world, but of these only two have furnished our gardens with
the best cultivated varieties, namely: the high blackberry (<i>R.
villosus</i><a href="#kitchen9" id="anch_kitchen9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>), growing everywhere in thickets, with a strong prickly
stem, six feet high, and the low blackberry, or dewberry (<i>R.
canadensis</i><a href="#kitchen10" id="anch_kitchen10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>), a long trailing plant, with slightly prickly stems,
and small, early ripening fruit.</p>

<p>The cultivation of the blackberry has been retarded to a
considerable extent by the excellence of the wild sorts—the
people being satisfied with the fruit of the bramble in the fence
row. The varieties that now head the list have all been chance
seedlings found growing wild, and afterward improved by garden
culture. The Lawton was found growing on a roadside
in Westchester county, New York, and is often known by the
name of its native town, New Rochelle. The Lawton did
much to introduce the blackberry to the fruit gardens. The
canes winter kill, and the fruit, unless perfectly ripe, is hard
and sour at the core. The Kittatinny stands among the first
for the size and richness of its fruit. This berry is a little earlier
than the New Rochelle. It was found near the Kittatinny
mountains, in New Jersey, and bears the peculiar Indian
name of the place of its nativity. Mr. Roe, in his “Success
with Small Fruits” says of the discoverer of the Kittatinny
blackberry: “He has done more for the world than if he had
opened a gold mine.”</p>

<p>The Wilson’s early is a third variety, of New Jersey origin,
that grows low, with the canes trailing upon the ground. As
the name indicates, this is a remarkably early blackberry, and
were it not subject to attacks from insects it would be a very
superior variety. The Snyder is of western origin, is wonderfully
productive and hardy. The small size of the berry is the
greatest defect of the Snyder. There are some recent candidates
for popular favor, but the four mentioned have been
found worthy of a place in the small fruit garden.</p>

<p>The blackberry prefers a rather dry soil, of medium richness.
On a moist and very fertile soil the canes grow rank and large
and produce very little fruit. The plants need to be set in
rows six to eight feet apart each way. It is best to set the
plants in autumn, because they start into growth very early in
the spring, before there is opportunity for transplanting.
Stakes or cheap wire trellises are usually provided for holding
up plants. The canes that grow up one season produce fruit
the succeeding year, and then die. It is therefore necessary
to treat as weeds all shoots that are not needed for the bearing
canes the following season. Judicious pruning of the cane
while it is growing will produce much branched tops, which
are more productive than those that grow to great length, and
they are less liable to be injured by frost. Mr. Roe says:
“More can be done with the thumb and finger at the right
time than with the most savage pruning shears after a year of
neglect.” The blackberry produces many suckers, and if these
are left to grow for a year or two the whole ground becomes
a wilderness that is not productive, and very difficult to subdue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strawberries.</span>—It is not an easy task to find the person
who dislikes strawberries. They are acceptable to the vast
majority, and in almost any form, from the plain berry just
picked off the vine to the juicy, red layer in a shortcake, or
the heaping saucer with its fragrant contents half floating in
sweet cream. The name strawberry probably came from the
old Saxon <i>streawberige</i>, either because of the strawlike stems
to the plants, or from the berries being strewn upon the ground.
In olden times children strung the berries upon straws and
sold them thus, and possibly from this we now have the name
for our earliest and finest of small fruits. The name of the
strawberry genus is <i>Fragaria</i>,<a href="#kitchen11" id="anch_kitchen11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> the Latin for “sweet smelling.”
The cultivated varieties of strawberries represent five species.
The most common one, growing wild almost everywhere being
<i>Fragaria vesca</i>. In this species the seeds are superficial on
the luscious cone. The Virginian strawberry, <i>F. Virginiana</i>,
abundant in all parts of the United States, has roundish fruit,
with the seeds embedded in deep pits. At the time of the introduction
of this species in English gardens the culture of the
strawberry took a fresh start. By sowing the seed of the Virginian
species new varieties have been produced in large numbers,
so that now it is the parent of nine-tenths of all the sorts
grown in our gardens. The Hovey, Wilson, monarch, Seth
Boyden, Charles Downy, and Sharpless are some of the improved
varieties of this species. A new impetus was given to
strawberry culture by the introduction of a South American
species, <i>F. grandiflora</i>. The fruit is large and sweet, with a
peculiar sprightliness that makes the varieties derived from
this species highly prized in England and on this continent.
Our cold winters and hot summers are too severe extremes for
these offsprings of a more tropical species. The triumphe de
gand and jucunda are two superb sorts derived from the <i>F.
grandiflora</i>.</p>

<p>Some varieties of strawberries have what are known as pistillate
flowers; that is, the stamens or male organs are imperfect
or wanting. In such cases it is necessary to grow a perfect-flowered
(bi-sexual) variety in close proximity, in order to
insure fertilization and the formation of fruit. The famous
Hovey seedling is a pistillate variety, and there are many others
of this character.</p>

<p>One of the leading features of the strawberry plant is to multiply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
by means of long, slender branches, called runners.
There are, however, three methods of propagating the strawberry,
viz.: by the runners, by division of the root, and by
seeds. The chief method is by runners. Strawberries need a
rich, mellow soil. The plants may be set either in the spring
or fall, though the spring is generally preferred by experienced
strawberry growers. Plants set in autumn will not come into
bearing the next season unless they are pot-grown. These
pot-grown plants are obtained by sinking small flower pots in
the earth of the strawberry bed, into the contents of which the
runners strike root and form plants. The roots of the plants
are not disturbed by transplanting, and one whole season is
gained. In setting out strawberry plants care needs to be observed
that the crown is not buried. The holes should be large,
so that the roots may be spread out in all directions. If set in
rows two and a half feet apart, and a foot or so distant in the
row, a horse and cultivator may be used to advantage in keeping
down the weeds. After two or three full crops have been
gathered from a bed the rows may be plowed up. Some growers
gather only one crop, and reset the land. There are many
methods of treatment. In the fall the strawberry bed should
be covered with a mulch. The success of many cultivators of
the strawberry is due, in great measure, to the protection of
their plants in winter.</p>

<p>The insect enemies to the strawberry are numerous, not the
least of which is the white grub, the larvæ of the May beetle
or “June Bug,” the strawberry worm, the leaf-roller, crown
borer, saw fly, and various cut worms. A rust sometimes attacks
the plants and almost ruins them.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to indicate what are the best varieties of
strawberries. Again referring to the chart in the last issue of
the American Pomological Society, we find forty-one varieties
there tabulated. Of these the Charles Downing and the Wilson
take the lead, being suited to a wide range of climate, soil,
and other conditions. The Downing is the type of excellence
in flavor and other qualities, while the Wilson is a firm, sour,
and very prolific berry well suited for the market garden.
Among the other sorts worthy of attention, mentioned alphabetically,
are: Crescent, Cumberland, Hovey, Kentucky, Manchester,
miner’s prolific, Monarch, Sharpless, and triumphe
de gand. A dozen or more new sorts appear each year, some
of which may take their places among the time-tested sorts
here mentioned. It may be that in a few years all of these
old varieties will be superseded by new sorts, and the berries
that we now eat with so much relish will seem poor by the
contrast. Let the future be as it may, no one should neglect
the culture of the kinds we now possess. A person with only
a village half acre may grow his own berries of various sorts,
and still have room for a few pear, apple, peach, and cherry trees.</p>

<p>Let us close this brief treatment of small fruits at the same
place where Mr. Roe began his large, elegant and exhaustive
book on the same subject, by quoting the following passage
from his “Preliminary Parley:” “Many think of the soil only
in connection with the sad words of the burial service, ‘earth
to earth, ashes to ashes.’ Let us, while we may, gain more
cheerful associations with our kindred dust. For a time it can
be earth to strawberry blossoms, ashes to bright red berries,
and their color will get into our cheeks, and their rich, sub-acid
juices into our insipid lives, constituting a mental, moral and
physical alteration that will so change us that we shall believe
in evolution, and imagine ourselves fit for a higher state of existence.
One may delve in the earth so long as to lose all
dread at the thought of sleeping in it at last, and the luscious
fruits and bright hued flowers that come out of it, in a way
no one can find out, may teach our own resurrection more
effectually than do the learned theologians.”</p>

<p>“The liberal use of various fruits as food is conducive to
good health. Fruit is not a solid and lasting element like
beef and bread, and does not give strength to any great extent.
But fruits contain those acids which refresh and give
tone to the system during the season when it is most needed.
They should never be eaten unless thoroughly ripe, or cooked.
Stale fruits, or those that have been plucked some time, are
unhealthy in the extreme. The proper time to eat fruit is in
the morning and early afternoon. At night it is ‘leaden,’
according to the Spanish, who call fruit ‘golden in the morning
and silver at noon.’” These words of general advice fitly
introduce our “apples, peaches, strawberries, and blackberries,”
for whose use, fresh and uncooked, we would strongly
plead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ripe Fruit.</span>—Wash and polish apples with a clean towel,
and pile in a china fruit basket, with an eye to agreeable variety
of color. Of peaches and pears the finest should be
selected, handling as little as may be, and pile upon a salver
or flat dish, with bits of ice between them, and ornament with
peach leaves or fennel sprigs. One of the prettiest dishes of
fruit I ever saw upon a dessert table was an open silver basket,
wide at the top, heaped with rich red peaches and yellow Bartlett
pears, interspersed with feathery bunches of green, which
few of those who admired it knew for carrot tops. Wild white
clematis wreathed the handle and showed here and there
among the fruit, while scarlet and white verbenas nestled amid
the green. Send around powdered sugar with the fruit, as
many like to dip peaches and pears in it after paring and
quartering them.</p>

<p>Never wash strawberries or raspberries that are intended to
be eaten as fresh fruit. If they are so gritty as to require this
process keep them off the table. You will certainly ruin the
flavor beyond repair if you wash them, and as certainly induce
instant fermentation and endanger the coats of the eaters’
stomachs, if, after profaning the exquisite delicacy of the fruit
to this extent, you complete the evil work by covering them
with sugar, and leaving them to leak their lives sourly away
for one or two hours. Put them on the table in glass dishes,
piling them high and lightly; send around powdered sugar
with them and cream, that the guests may help themselves.
It is not economical, perhaps, but it is a healthful and pleasant
style of serving them—I had almost said the only decent one.
“But I don’t know who picked them,” cries Mrs. Fussy.</p>

<p>No, my dear madame! nor do you know who makes the
baker’s bread, or confectioner’s cake, creams, jellies, salads,
etc. Nor, for that matter, how the flour is manufactured out
of which you conjure your dainty biscuits and pies. I <i>know</i>
God made strawberries. “Doubtless,” says Bishop Butler, “he
could have made a better berry, but he never did.” The picker’s
light touch can not mar flavor or beauty, nor, were her
fingers filthy as a chimney sweep’s, could the delicate fruit suffer
from them as from your barbarous baptism.—<i>Marion Harland
in “Common Sense in the Household.”</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Puddings and Pies.</span>—<i>Apple Dumplings.</i>—Make a crust as
for biscuit, or a potato crust, as follows: Three large potatoes
boiled and mashed while hot. Add to them two cups of sifted
flour and one teaspoonful of salt, and mix thoroughly. Now
chop or cut into it one small cup of butter, and mix into a
paste with about a teacupful of cold water. Dredge the board
thick with flour, and roll out—thick in the middle and thin at
the edges. A thick pudding-cloth—the best being made of
Canton flannel, used with the nap-side out—should be dipped
in hot water and wrung out, dredged evenly and thickly with
flour, and laid over a large bowl. Upon the middle of this
place the rolled-out crust, fill with apples pared and quartered,
eight or ten good-sized ones being enough for this amount of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
crust. Gather the edges of the crust evenly over it. Then
gather the cloth up, leaving room for the dumpling to swell,
and tying very tightly. In turning out, lift to a dish, press all
the water from the ends of the cloth; untie and turn away
from the pudding, and lay a hot dish upon it, turning over the
pudding into it, and serving at once, as it darkens or falls by
standing. In using a boiler, butter well, and fill only two-thirds
full, that the mixture may have room to swell. Set it in
boiling water, and see that it is kept at the same height, about
an inch from the top. Cover the outer kettle, that the steam
may be kept in. Peaches pared and halved, or canned ones
drained from the syrup, may be used instead of the apples.
When canned fruit is used the syrup can be used as a sauce,
either cold for cold puddings and blancmanges, or heated and
thickened for hot, allowing to a pint of juice a heaping teaspoonful
of corn starch, dissolved in a little cold water, and
boiling it five minutes. Strawberry or raspberry syrup is
especially nice.</p>

<p><i>Bread and Apple Pudding.</i>—Butter a deep pudding dish
and put first a layer of crumbs, then one of any good acid
apple, sliced rather thin, and so on until the dish is nearly full.
Six or eight apples and a quart of fresh crumbs will fill a two-quart
dish. Dissolve a cup of sugar and one teaspoonful of
cinnamon in one pint of boiling water and pour into the dish.
Let the pudding stand half an hour to swell; then bake until
brown—about three-quarters of an hour—and eat with liquid
sauce. It can be made with slices of bread and butter instead
of crumbs.</p>

<p><i>Short-Cake.</i>—One quart of flour, one teaspoonful of salt and
two of baking powder sifted with the flour, one cup of butter,
or half lard and half butter, one large cup of hot milk. Rub
the butter into the flour; add the milk and roll out the dough,
cutting in small square cakes and baking to a light brown.
For a strawberry or peach short-cake have three tin pie-plates
buttered; roll the dough to fit them, and bake quickly. Fill
either, when done, with a cup of sugar, or with peaches cut
fine and sugared, and served hot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pies—Apple, Peach, and Berry.</span>—In the first place, don’t
make them except very semi-occasionally. Pastry, even
when good, is so indigestible that children should never have
it, and their elders but seldom. A nice short-cake, filled with
stewed fruit, or with fresh berries, mashed and sweetened, is
quite as agreeable to eat and far more wholesome. But, as
people will both make and eat pie-crust, the best rules known
are given. Butter, being more wholesome than lard, should
always be used if it can be afforded. A mixture of lard and
butter is next best. For a plain pie-crust, take: One quart of
flour, one even teacup of lard and one of butter, one teacup of
ice water or very cold water, and a teaspoonful of salt. Rub
the lard and salt into the flour till it is dry and crumbly, add
the ice water and work to a smooth dough. Wash the butter
and have it cold and firm as possible, divide it in three parts.
Roll out the paste and dot it all over with bits from one part
of the butter, sprinkle with flour and roll up. Roll out and repeat
until the butter is gone. If the crust can now stand on
the ice for half an hour it will be nicer and more flaky. This
amount will make three good-sized pies. Enough for the bottom
crusts can be taken off after one rolling in of butter, thus
making the top crust richer. Lard alone will make a tender,
but not a flaky, paste.</p>

<p>For puff paste there is required one pound of flour, three
quarters of a pound of butter, one teacupful of ice water, one
teaspoonful of salt, one of sugar, and yolk of one egg. Wash
the butter, divide into three parts, reserving a bit the size of
an egg, and put it on the ice for an hour. Rub the bit of butter,
the salt, and sugar, into the flour, and stir in the ice water
and egg beaten together. Make into a dough and knead on
the moulding-board till glossy and firm—at least ten minutes
will be required. Roll out into a sheet ten or twelve inches
square. Cut a cake of the ice-cold butter in thin slices, or
flatten it very thin with the rolling-pin. Lay it on the
paste, sprinkle with flour, and fold over the edges. Press
it in somewhat with the rolling-pin and roll out again.
Always roll <i>from</i> you. Do this again and again until the butter
is all used, rolling up the paste after the last cake is in, and
then putting it on the ice for an hour or more. Have filling all
ready, and let the paste be as nearly ice-cold as possible when
it goes into the oven. There are much more elaborate rules,
but this insures handsome paste. Make a plainer one for the
bottom crusts. Cover puff paste with a damp cloth and it
may be kept on the ice a day or two before baking.</p>

<p><i>Apple Pie.</i>—Line a pie-plate with plain paste. Pare sour
apples—greenings are best—quarter and cut in thin slices.
Allow one cup of sugar, and quarter of a grated nutmeg mixed
with it. Fill the pie-plate heaping full of the sliced apple,
sprinkling the sugar between the layers. It will require not
less than six good-sized apples. Wet the edges of the pie with
cold water, lay on the cover and press down securely, that no
juice may escape. Bake three-quarters of an hour, or a little
less if the apples are very tender. No pie in which the apples
are stewed beforehand can compare with this in flavor. If
they are used stew till tender and strain. Sweeten and flavor
to taste. Fill the pies and bake half an hour.</p>

<p><i>Berry Pies.</i>—Have a very deep plate, and either no under
crust, save a rim, or a very thin one. Allow a cup of sugar to
a quart of fruit, but no spices. Prick the upper crust half a
dozen times with a fork, to let out the steam.—<i>Helen Campbell,
in “The Easiest Way in Housekeeping and Cooking.”</i></p>

<p><i>Apple Méringue Pies.</i>—Stew and sweeten ripe, juicy apples,
when you have pared and sliced them. Mash smooth and
season with nutmeg. If you like the flavor, stew some lemon
peel with the apple, and remove when cold. Fill your crust
and bake until just done. Spread over the apple a thick
méringue,<a href="#apples1" id="anch_apples1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> made by whipping to a stiff froth the whites of three
eggs for each pie, sweetening with a tablespoonful of powdered
sugar for each egg. Flavor this with rose-water or vanilla;
beat until it will stand alone, and cover the pie three-quarters
of an inch thick. Set back in the oven until the méringue is
well “set.” Should it color too darkly, sift powdered sugar
over it when cold. Eat cold. Peach pies are even more delicious
made in this manner.</p>

<p><i>Apple Snow</i> requires six apples, whites of two eggs and
three tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar. Peel and grate the
apples into the whites, which must have been whipped to a
stiff froth. Beat in the sugar with a few light sweeps of the
egg; whip and set in a cold place until wanted. Eat with
crackers or cake.—<i>Marion Harland.</i></p>

<p><i>Apple Fritters.</i>—Pare some fine apples, and with an apple-corer
cut out the core from the center of each; now cut them
across in slices, about one-third of an inch thick, having the
round opening in the center, dip these in a fritter batter and
fry in boiling lard; sprinkle over sugar. Fresh or canned
peaches may be used in the same way.—<i>Mrs. Henderson, in
“Practical Cooking.”</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Putting Up Fruit.</span>—One of the most satisfactory operations
which is carried on in the household is the annual putting up
of fruit. To be sure, it has its disadvantages, like everything
else. The fruit generally gets ripe a week or two earlier than
you expect it will, and is brought to you on a day for which
you have planned other work; but, after all, there is to the
well-regulated mind a rare pleasure in being confronted with
a basket of luscious fruit which may be preserved for enjoyment
in the winter; and I maintain that the pleasure we
receive in midwinter from a dish of peaches, cherries, or
plums on the table is not wholly of the senses, but the mind
itself enjoys the contrasting picture which inevitably comes
before it. Something of the brightness of the long summer
days in which it grew and ripened is felt again, and just as
chopped pickle in June will suggest a November day when the
tomatoes no longer ripen, the cucumbers have gone to seed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
and the frost has covered the tangled vines in the garden with
a fairy-like network, so red raspberries and pears in December
and March minister to other wants than those of the palate.
Half the trouble of putting up fruit—the broken cans,
the scalded fingers and stained dresses—might be done away
with if a woman could enter upon the work in the right spirit.
If, instead of complaining in May because the trees are full of
blossoms, and exhausting ourselves mentally by putting up the
fruit and having it spoil long before it is ripe, we were to refrain
from asking if we shall live to eat it or to see it eaten, we
should accomplish something really great in preserving our
peace of mind as well as our fruit. It is a simple matter also,
if entered into with calm cheerfulness, to look over and can
the fruit. After the fruit has been carefully examined, set it in
a cool room or into the refrigerator, while you examine your
cans. It is well to have some new rubber rings on hand, as
you may need them; have also a cup of flour paste ready;
then if the zinc rings or covers are bent a little, you may still
make them air-tight with the paste. If you are at all doubtful
about the condition of your cans, use the paste. In a long experience
of putting up fruit I have never broken but one can,
and that was on account of carelessness in rinsing it in too
hot water. I rinse the can in warm water, then set it in a two-quart
basin with a little water in it, set it on the stove beside
my porcelain kettle, fill the can with boiling fruit, and seal up
as quickly as may be. One thing which should be carefully
avoided is too much boiling of the fruit after the sugar is put
with it. The injury which boiling does is not by any means
well understood by many good cooks. Last year I gave up all
the care of putting up fruit and pickles to a competent and
honest girl; but, by her not knowing that sugar, when boiled,
actually changes its nature, and loses much of its sweetness,
she used more than twice the quantity which I have used this
year, and then the fruit was not so sweet as it ought to be.
(When making syrup to eat on hot cakes bear this in mind:
after the sugar is dissolved let it come to a boil, but do not boil it.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peaches.</span>—If possible, pare and cut up your peaches the
afternoon before they are to be canned, and scatter sugar over
them. In the morning there will be syrup enough to cook
them in. Put this syrup into your porcelain kettle—if you
have one, if not, into a bright tin pan; cook a few peaches at
a time, try them with a broom-splint; just before they are
done add the necessary quantity of sugar. Some housekeepers
make a practice of putting one whole peach into a can, to
give the almond flavor of the stone to the whole can. You
can not, of course, guess at just the number of halves or
quarters needed to fill the can; if you have too many pieces,
and are afraid of their cooking too much, take them out carefully
on a plate and, after cooking others for the next canful,
add to them. By cooking a few at a time you can preserve
the shape and have much finer results than if you cook a great
many at a time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quinces and Sweet Apples.</span>—Prepare the quinces and
apples as for canning. Steam them in the same way,
having about one-third as many quinces as apples. Make a
very sweet syrup, as they will keep better with plenty of sugar.
These may be canned or kept in a large stone jar.—<i>Emma
Whitcomb Babcock, in “Household Hints.”</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Preserves.</span>—Preserves are scarcely needed if canning is
nicely done. They require much more trouble, and are too
rich for ordinary use, a pound of sugar to one of fruit being
required. If made at all, the fruit must be very fresh, and the
syrup perfectly clear. For syrup allow one teacup of cold
water to every pound of sugar, and, as it heats, add to every
three or four pounds the white of an egg. Skim very carefully,
boiling till no more rises, and it is ready for use. Peaches,
pears, green gages, cherries, and crab-apples are all preserved
alike. Peel, stone, and halve peaches, and boil only a few
pieces at a time till clear. Peel, core, and halve pears. Prick
plums and gages several times. Core crab-apples, and cut
half the stem from cherries. Cook till tender. Put up <i>when
cold</i> in small jars, and paste paper over them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jams.</span>—Make syrup as directed above. Use raspberries,
strawberries, or any small fruit, and boil for half an hour. Put
up in small jars or tumblers; lay papers dipped in brandy on
the fruit, and paste on covers, or use patent jelly-glasses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marmalade.</span>—Quinces make the best; but crab-apples or
any sour apple are also good. Poor quinces, unfit for other
use, can be washed and cut in small pieces, coring, but not
paring them. Allow three-quarters of a pound of sugar and
a teacupful of water to a pound of fruit, and boil slowly two
hours, stirring, and mashing it fine. Strain through a colander,
and put up in glasses or bowls. Peach marmalade is made in
the same way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fruit Jellies.</span>—Crab-apple, quince, grape, etc., are all
made in the same way. Allow a teacup of water to a pound
of fruit; boil till very tender; then strain through a cloth, and
treat as currant jelly. Cherries will not jelly without gelatine,
and grapes are sometimes troublesome. Where gelatine is
needed, allow a package to two quarts of juice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Candied Fruits.</span>—Make a syrup as for preserves, and boil
any fruit, prepared as directed, until tender. Let them stand
two days in the syrup. Take out; drain carefully; lay them
on plates; sift sugar over them, and dry either in the sun or in
a moderately warm oven.—<i>Helen Campbell, in “The Easiest
Way in Housekeeping and Cooking.”</i></p>

<h3>AIR.—PHYSICAL PROPERTIES.</h3>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>To make the <i>weight</i> for the winds.—Job xxviii:25.</p>

</div>

<p>One day an old Florentine pump-maker came to Galileo<a href="#chemistry1" id="anch_chemistry1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> to
inquire why he could not make a pump work effectively
when it was more than thirty-four feet long. The philosopher
could not answer, nor did he solve the problem during
his lifetime, but bequeathed it to his pupil, Torricelli.<a href="#chemistry2" id="anch_chemistry2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> This
famous Italian succeeded in partially answering the question
in 1643. He performed the following experiment: Taking a
glass tube thirty-six inches long and one-fourth of an inch in
diameter, closed at one end, he filled it with mercury, and
holding his finger over the open end, inverted and placed it in
a cup of mercury, then removing his finger, discovered that the
quicksilver settled in the tube six inches, leaving a column of
the shining metal thirty inches high. He thus demonstrated
that air has weight, equal to that of a column of mercury thirty
inches in height.</p>

<p>On this supposition it was argued that if the whole height of
the air should be <i>lessened</i> the column would fall. Such was
the opinion of Blaise Pascal,<a href="#chemistry3" id="anch_chemistry3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> who in 1646 requested M. Périer,
his brother-in-law, to ascend the Puy de Dome, a summit near
Clermont, and repeat the experiment of Torricelli. To his delight,
upon reaching the top of the mountain, the column stood
three inches lower. Pascal then used a tube fifty feet long,
which he filled with water, and found that this liquid could be
supported by the air to the height of thirty-four feet. Water is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
13.6 lighter than mercury, and it will be observed from the
foregoing statement, that it was supported 13.6 higher than
quicksilver. Here was a full answer to the pump-maker’s
query! A column of water, thirty-four feet long and one square
inch at the base, weighs fifteen pounds. A column of mercury,
thirty inches long and one square inch at the base,
weighs fifteen pounds. A column of air the whole height of
the atmosphere, one square inch at the base, weighs fifteen
pounds.</p>

<p>Any influence, therefore, which varies the weight of the air,
will vary the height of a column of quicksilver; and the reverse
will of course be true, that any fluctuation in the column
of mercury indicates a change in the condition of the atmosphere.
Thus, a “falling barometer” predicts foul weather, for
it shows that the air is becoming lighter, and will therefore rise,
while other air will rush in, with varying speed, to take its
place, producing breezes, gales, and possibly tornadoes. The
warm air rising may come in contact with a cold stratum
above and its moisture be condensed into rain or snow. We
shall presently refer to this again.</p>

</div>

<p>A quart of air, at ordinary temperature, weighs about eight
hundred times less than a quart of water, yet the aggregate
pressure of the atmosphere is equal to fifteen pounds on every
square inch. A person of average size presents a surface of
about two thousand square inches. This would receive a pressure
of fifteen tons, a weight more crushing than that of all the
shields cast upon the traitorous Tarpeia<a href="#chemistry4" id="anch_chemistry4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> at the Roman gate.</p>

<p>Herschel calculates that the total weight of the atmosphere
is one twelve-hundred-thousandth of that of the earth.</p>

<p>Why does not such enormous pressure destroy life? Because
it is counterbalanced by the pressure of air, gases and
blood within the body. That this is true may readily be seen
in the process of dry-cupping. Bare the arm, take a bit of
writing paper an inch and a half long, dip it in alcohol, light,
and instantly place in a small wine glass, and at once apply
the glass to the soft part of the arm. The flesh under the glass
will rise like a pin-cushion, and become red from the pressure
of the blood within. Persons going down in diving-bells suffer
from the condensation of the air in the bell, while on a high
mountain they experience a pressure in the opposite direction,
on account of the rarefaction of the atmosphere, the blood
often gushing from the nose and ears.</p>

<p>We shall better understand the phenomena of the air by first
considering some of its distinctive properties.</p>

<h4>AIR PRESSES EQUALLY IN ALL DIRECTIONS.</h4>

<p>This great principle, which applies to all gases as well as to
fluids, has many illustrations in nature. The haliotis<a href="#chemistry5" id="anch_chemistry5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> is held
to the rock with a tenacity which sometimes resists the strength
of the collector, who would add its iridescent beauty to his

by a skate!<a href="#chemistry6" id="anch_chemistry6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Quickly descending to the bottom, this broad,
flat fish expels the air from beneath it, and defies all effort at
capture.</p>

<p>The most complete demonstration of this law is shown by
the Magdeburg hemispheres,<a href="#chemistry7" id="anch_chemistry7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> invented by Otto von Güricke<a href="#chemistry8" id="anch_chemistry8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
and used by him before Charles V. and his brilliant court.
They are still preserved in the ancient city which gave them
their name, are twenty-four inches in diameter, and after the
air in them had been removed, required twelve horses to separate
them.</p>

<p>The pressure of the air varies greatly at different altitudes.
At the height of three and one-half miles the column of mercury
in a barometer falls to fifteen inches, showing that below
that elevation we have as much air as in all the space above.</p>

<p>The boiling point of liquids is materially influenced by the
pressure of the atmosphere. On high mountains potatoes and
even eggs can not be cooked by boiling, as the water will all
evaporate before it is heated sufficiently to cook them.</p>

<p>Partially fill a glass flask with water, heat it until steam begins
to escape, then remove the lamp and insert a stopper, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
boiling will cease. Now pour cold water upon the flask, and
the water within begins again to boil vigorously. The cold
water condenses the steam, creating a partial vacuum, thus
relieving the heated water from pressure, and it boils at a lower
temperature than 212°. This illustrates the famous culinary
paradox that “cold water will make hot water boil.”</p>

<p>The buoyancy of substances in air depends upon the same
principle that determines their buoyancy in liquids. It will be
proportioned to the amount of air which they displace.</p>

<p>It is correct to say that a balloon rises because the air is
heavier, and therefore pushes under the balloon and forces
it up; or, that it rises because it displaces more than its own
weight of air. Thistle-down may be compressed so that it will
fall like shot. The resistance offered by the air to the fall of
bodies led men long to hold to the fallacy that the rapidity of
the descent of falling bodies was proportioned to their weight.
This error was at length exploded by Galileo in his interesting
experiment on the leaning tower of Pisa.<a href="#chemistry9" id="anch_chemistry9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> In a vacuum, a

<p class="caption">AIR PUMP.</p>
</div>

<h4>COMPRESSIBILITY.</h4>

<p>The statement that air can be expanded involves the counter-truth
that it may be compressed.</p>

<p>Mariotte<a href="#chemistry10" id="anch_chemistry10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> announces the law as follows: Doubling the pressure
upon a given amount of gas will halve the space it occupies,
and double its expansive energy. The application of
this principle in one form gives us the air-gun.<a href="#chemistry11" id="anch_chemistry11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> If the air in
a gun-barrel forty inches long were compressed into the space
of half an inch it would press with eighty times its previous
force, or with a power equal to twelve hundred pounds to the
square inch. Compressed air is often used as a power in
mines and excavations, and its advantages are many; it was
so employed in the Hoosac tunnel. Though the engine that
compressed the air was three miles away, the loss from friction
was very slight, and the air, having performed its work in
driving the drill, was then liberated to purify the atmosphere
of the tunnel and expel noxious gases which accumulated from
continuous blasting. The apparatus for compressing air is
called a condenser. It consists essentially of a cylinder and
piston, with a valve in the bottom of each, opening downward.
A precisely opposite arrangement of valves is found in the air-pump,
a machine for exhausting air from a given space, usually
a receiver. As the piston is raised in removing the air,
the valve closes, and the air is thus forced out of the cylinder;
the air in the receiver then expands, opens the valve at the
bottom of the cylinder, and rises into it; as the piston descends
its valve is opened; rising, it again removes the cylinder
full of air; the air in the receiver again expands, opens the
lower valve, and so continues, until the air in the vessel becomes
too much rarefied to lift the delicate valve and make its
escape. The vacuum thus produced is by no means so perfect
as the “Torricellian vacuum,”<a href="#chemistry12" id="anch_chemistry12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> the name given to the
unoccupied space above the column of mercury in a barometer.</p>

<p>Various substances may be placed in a receiver to show the
expansive tendency of air. A piece of wood immersed in a jar
of water will throw off thousands of little bubbles. A shriveled
apple will become round and plump. The air in an empty
rubber bag will often expand so as to fill the receiver. Air in
a thin glass vessel, tightly corked, will expand so as to burst the
vessel into fragments.</p>

<p>The following simple but useful piece of apparatus can easily
be made: Take a pint bottle with a nicely fitted cork, through
the cork insert a small glass tube so as to be perfectly air-tight
(melted sealing wax is convenient for making tubes or glass
tight;) a perforated <i>rubber</i> stopper is better. Let the end of
the tube inserted be drawn out in the flame of an alcohol lamp
(this is not essential, but will make the experiments more interesting),
suck the air from the bottle, close the end of the
tube at once with the finger and place it in a glass of water,
and a miniature fountain, in vacuo, will be revealed. After
performing this pretty experiment remove the tube and reinsert
it with the larger end down, having filled the bottle two-thirds
full of water. With the lips force a quantity of air into
the bottle, upon removing the mouth the water will rise in the
tube and fall in a fine spray from the small aperture at the top.
This last experiment is particularly interesting, as it is a perfect
illustration of a flowing oil well. Closely allied to the expansibility
of air is its</p>

<h4>ELASTICITY,</h4>

<p class="unindent">Or tendency to regain its former volume after being compressed.
Many a school-boy has observed this property,
while manipulating his fascinating popgun. When he places
his finger over the open end of the piece of elder, utilized as a
gun, and suddenly pushes down the piston upon the wad, he
notices that it quickly flies back. An inflated bladder thrown
upon the floor bounds like a rubber ball; force pumps in our
houses act upon this principle. The air in the chamber of the
pump is first compressed by the entrance of the water; it reacts
like a spring, and forces the water through the pipes to the
rooms above.</p>

<p class="caption">EXPANDING RUBBER BAG IN AN EXHAUSTED RECEIVER.</p>
</div>

<p>The hydraulic ram is another application of the same principle.
Perhaps the reader may know some place where this
apparatus can be used. Let us briefly describe the conditions
of its operation. Near your house, at a lower elevation, may be
a beautiful spring, so situated that, within the distance of about
seventy feet, a fall of from five to ten feet can be obtained.
Now run a large pipe from the spring to the spot where the ram
is to be placed, below the level of the spring. The ram is a
pear-shaped, cast iron cylinder, open at the small end, at
which point a valve is placed, opening upward. The pipe
coming from the spring is screwed into the bottom of the ram
below this valve, in such a manner as to conduct the water
past the valve, and out through an opening beyond. At this
point, however, is placed a metallic valve, against which, as
the water escapes, it continues to crowd. Presently the rushing
stream obtains sufficient momentum to close this valve,
and thus prevent for a moment its further escape. The accumulated
force of the water then raises the valve in the bottom
of the ram and it rises into the chamber, which is partially
filled with air. This air is compressed, but on account of its
elasticity at once reacts upon the water and forces it through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
another pipe to the required height. Only about one-eighth of
the water is sent through the last pipe, as seven-eighths of it is
required to force the remainder to the desired elevation. I
have a great respect for this useful apparatus, the invention of
the elder Montgolfier.<a href="#chemistry13" id="anch_chemistry13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> I know of one hydraulic ram which
for fifteen years has raised, through a pipe twenty-two hundred
feet long, to an elevation of seventy-five feet, an average of
twenty-four barrels of water daily. Its total cost for repairs
has not exceeded twenty-five dollars, and yet it has done every
day the work of four men. If men had been hired to do this
labor at $1.50 per day each, their wages would have amounted
to the snug sum of $32,850.</p>

<p>Atmospheric pressure is employed in many of our cities to
convey packages from one part of a building to another, and
to even greater distances. This “Pneumatic Dispatch”<a href="#chemistry14" id="anch_chemistry14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> system,
as it is called, was first tried successfully in Paris, in 1865.
A company was then established, which now claims to send
eight hundred and thirty packages daily. In our own country
this curious appliance may be seen in operation at the United
States Express office in New York City, in the mammoth establishment
of Mr. Wanamaker, in Philadelphia, and doubtless
in many other places. For many years attempts have
been made to propel cars by compressed air, but as yet the
expense of such a plan greatly exceeds that of steam.</p>

<h4>LIGHT.</h4>

<p>Among the most gracious and beautiful offices performed by
the atmosphere is the reflection and refraction of light. The
blue dome of the sky, the magnificent coloring of the clouds,
and all the delicate and ever varying tints of the morning and
evening twilight are due to its influence. Without the air we
should be in complete darkness until the sun rose, a fiery ball,
above the horizon. All day long the only light we should receive
would come directly from the sun, or be reflected from
objects on the earth. At sunset, darkness would instantly be
spread over us like a pall. No gentle gradations of light and
deepening shade would usher in and close the day.</p>

<p>All must have observed during the past year the remarkable
appearance of the western sky after the sun had set. Cities were
more than once supposed to be burning, reflecting their lurid
blaze upon the clouds. The cause of this is still a matter of
dispute, but is generally attributed to the presence of star
dust, or some minute mineral matter suspended in the higher
atmosphere.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that color is not an inherent property
of a substance, but depends upon what portion of the light
rays it absorbs. Snow is white, as it absorbs none of the prismatic
colors, but reflects them all to the eye. Whatever, then,
varies the absorbing or reflecting power of an object varies its
tints. Thus, objects seen on the horizon are red, because the
dense atmosphere has turned aside the violet, indigo, blue,
green, yellow and orange, and only the red color reaches the
eye.</p>

<p>Observe that the initial letter of the prismatic colors taken
in their order make the word “vibgyor.”</p>

<p>Again, were there no atmosphere, there could be no</p>

<h4>CLOUDS NOR RAIN.</h4>

<p>The moon is destitute of these, or at least that half of it
which is always turned toward us. The most powerful telescopes
can detect there the presence of neither atmosphere
nor cloud.</p>

<p>A most remarkable proof of divine wisdom can be seen in
the nice adjustment by which the pressure of the air prevents
undue evaporation from the lakes and seas, and at the same
time furnishes the medium by which moisture is conveyed to the
remotest parts of the earth. The fact that water, in the form
of mist or clouds, should float, and not fall in a substance
many times lighter than itself, is one of the most wonderful
of nature’s phenomena. When shot are dropped into water,
we expect that they will sink; yet lead is but eleven times
heavier than water, while water is eight hundred times heavier
than air.</p>

<p>The following seems to be the most satisfactory explanation
of the matter: It is a well known fact that the air has the
power to absorb and hold, in an invisible form, a certain
amount of moisture. The quantity which it can contain depends
upon its temperature. If the air is cooled, it parts with
a portion; thus if the grass radiates its heat, dew is deposited
upon it; if it is very cold, the frost covers it with sparkling
crystals. It is thought that when cooling from any cause takes
place in higher altitudes, the atmospheric moisture changes from
the invisible to the visible form, and assumes the physical condition
of spheroids or vesicles, minute bubbles of water in point
of fact, each bubble filled with air. These bubbles, heated by
the sun’s rays, would become lighter than the medium in which
they float, for the same reason that soap bubbles float while
they are warm. In this condition they are drifted along by
currents until they reach a colder stratum of air, when they
are condensed and fall as rain. If cooled sufficiently, snow
would be formed.</p>

<p>Cloud forms are four in number, cirrus, cumulus, nimbus,
and stratus, all of which may sometimes be seen at once, in
the sky of a summer’s day. At times they float above the loftiest
mountains. Gay-Lussac,<a href="#chemistry15" id="anch_chemistry15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> rising in his balloon to an elevation
of 21,600 feet, perceived clouds drifting far above him.</p>

<p>The work performed by the atmosphere in supplying water
to the soil is worthy of profound attention. Close observation
shows that it varies in amount, year by year, much less than one
would suppose. For example, the average yearly rain-fall in
western New York, for the last thirteen years, has been thirty-six
inches. Contrary to the general impression, the record shows
a slight yearly increase in the amount. While this is true, the
quantity of water carried down by our rivers is constantly diminishing.
All must have observed the lessening size of our
streams. Many a mill has ceased to run from lack of its former
supply of water. This has resulted from the destruction
of forests, and clearing of land, which have greatly increased
evaporation of moisture from the soil. So grave a matter has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
this become, that it is attracting the attention of governments,
because of its relation to agriculture and the navigation of
rivers.</p>

<p>One can have but little idea, unless he carefully calculates
it, of the inestimable blessings conferred by the atmosphere
upon man, in furnishing to the soil its supply of water.</p>

<h4>MR. THOUGHTFUL THANKFUL,</h4>

<p class="unindent">Being disposed properly to acknowledge the care of a kind
Providence, in carrying on the work of his farm, one day sat
down to figure out the value of a recent shower, which had refreshed
his crops. The leaves of his corn had begun to curl,
the oats and wheat were growing prematurely yellow, a few
more days of the scorching heat and drouth would have made
his harvests a failure, but to his great relief a plenteous shower
fell. The rain gauge showed half an inch of water. Mr.
Thankful took out his pencil and, after careful mathematical
calculations, arrived at this astounding conclusion: An unseen
hand had conveyed from a remote distance, and deposited
upon every acre of his little farm, more than fifty-six tons of
water. He owns a hundred acres. There must therefore have
been scattered upon the entire farm over 5,600 tons of rain, an
amount so large that if he had been compelled to pay for its
transportation it would have required more than all the income
of his farm.</p>

<h4>SOUND.</h4>

<p>Our atmosphere is the medium of sound. Upon lofty mountains
its vibrations become faint, while in a vacuum all sound
ceases. The world of music, with which we are surrounded,
were the air removed, would become forever silent. No song
of birds, no murmur of the brook, no sighing of the trees, no
thunder of the cataract, no grand diapason of the sea, no
sweet voice of friendship, no thrilling words of love could ever
again fall upon human ear. Gather together in one heap of
useless rubbish (for they will never more be needed), harp,
lyre, flute, flageolet, violin and guitar, piano and organ. Even
that harp of three thousand strings, which the divine hand has
placed in the human ear, shall not again vibrate to the delicate
touch of nature’s hand.</p>

<h4>ELECTRICITY AND METEORS.</h4>

<p>We will close our present article by mentioning two other
interesting atmospheric phenomena.</p>

<p>Dr. Franklin proved that lightning and electricity are identical.
This wonderful agent manifests itself in a variety of
ways. The zigzag track of light across the darkened sky, with
its accompanying crash, is one of nature’s exhibitions of tremendous
power. The irregularity of its path is due to the resistance
of the air, compressed by the electric motion. The
beautiful illumination called heat or sheet lightning, is caused
by the reflection of the electric flash, at a great distance from
the observer.</p>

<p>A very curious form of electricity is that known as St. Elmo’s
fire, which appears as a glowing ball, often poising itself
on the spars of ships, to the great consternation of superstitious
sailors.</p>

<p>Judge Dana, in his admirable book, “Two Years Before the
Mast,” more than once alludes to the sensation caused by
these weird visitors, as they rounded stormy Cape Horn.</p>

<p>The northern lights, or aurora borealis, with their throbbing,
shifting, crimson and purple tints, sometimes called “the
merry dancers,” are supposed to be produced by the discharge
of electricity in high altitudes and in rarefied air. All around
us there is slumbering this power, which science may some day
awaken to do the common work of the world.</p>

<p>Meteors, or “shooting stars,” as they are often incorrectly
called, are small bodies, often not larger than grains of sand,
which rush into our atmosphere at a speed equal to the earth’s
motion, eleven hundred miles a minute, and by friction are set
on fire, and blaze for a moment in the sky. Lockyer<a href="#chemistry16" id="anch_chemistry16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> says that
seven millions of these, visible to the naked eye, traverse our
atmosphere in a single day, and that a powerful telescope would
reveal in the same time not less than four hundred millions.</p>

<p>Once in thirty-three years an astonishing display of these
celestial fireworks takes place. The last was in 1866. At that
time these bodies chanced to cross the track of the earth’s orbit,
and were thus brought into collision with it. The largest
of them, called meteorites, sometimes pass through the atmosphere
unconsumed and reach the earth. They have been
known to kill both men and cattle.</p>

<p>In 1866 one thousand of these stones, the largest weighing
six hundred pounds, fell in Hungary.</p>

<p>It is very incorrect to call these flashing bodies in the air
shooting stars, for they are extremely minute in size, while stars
are vast suns; again, in point of distance, they are different,
being near at hand, while the latter are millions of miles away.
It would be difficult to find an instance in which language can
convey a greater error than this phrase, which constantly implies
that vast worlds, by thousands, are flying hither and
thither, like sky-rockets. Often a single glance at the sky on
a clear night, would show how unsafe this world would be as
the object of such tremendous cannonading.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.—THE HALL.</h3>

<p>In studying how to make home beautiful, we must not forget
that, first of all, there must be a home; and that in a true
home, the household, and not the house, is of primary importance.
We have all seen careful housekeepers whose first
and last thought was to keep their domains with absolute
neatness, and whose domestic law was of Median and Persian
inflexibility. Overshoes must be left here; slippers must be
put on there; the front stair-carpet must only be trodden by
the visitor’s foot; the front door-latch must never be lifted by
the children’s hand; curtains must be drawn close lest carpets
fade; and autumn fires remain unlighted lest ashes fly. These
were housekeepers, not home makers. The virtue of carefulness
is a housewife’s glory; but when carried to an excess, it
becomes a woman’s shame, leading her to imagine that meat
is more than life, raiment than body, and house than man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Of the virtuous woman we read first: “She openeth her mouth
with wisdom, and in her tongue is the law of kindness;” then
that “she looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth
not the bread of idleness;” after which it follows naturally
that “her children rise up and call her blessed, her husband
also, and he praiseth her;” but when the devil of neatness enters
into a woman he defies family comfort, and banishes the
angel of peace from the home. And yet comfort, important
though its place may be in the home economy, is not to be the
first aim. A wise critic says: “Every house should have in
it that which tells of strength, and seems to favor self-sacrifice,
simplicity, self-control. Nothing is finer in a house than a
kind of subtle ubiquitous spirit, which asserts the superiority
of the household, and tells you that they fear neither hunger
nor cold, neither toil nor danger, and do not bow down, night
and morning to the vulgar divinity, Comfort.” Not the house
we live in, but the life we live in it is that on which the real
beauty of home depends. In the House Beautiful, not Mr.
Cook’s, nor Mrs. Allen’s, but in that incomparable House
Beautiful which Bunyan has described for us, even there the
boy Matthew fell sick from tampering with the fruit of Beelzebub’s
garden. Compared with this soundness of inner life in
the house, these questions of outer adornment, of taste, or expediency,
or expense, are but unimportant matters, since no
home can be truly beautiful that is tarnished by an unworthy
life within its walls.</p>

<p>So much of preliminary statement must be pardoned me,
because in the refined paganism of these days there seems to
be a mania for magnifying the house we live in, and the highest
religion of many a family is simply to make their home
beautiful and attractive. It is better than no religion at all—but
a higher religion teaches us to make the homes of the poor
comfortable before—we make our own beautiful, shall I say?
Not at all; but before we spend freely to gain this end. For
the external beauty of home does not depend on the amount
of money spent in its adornment. Money buys a great deal
of clutter that had far better be left in the shops; money buys
a vast amount of superfluous stuck-on ornaments, that were
better left off, but money does not and can not buy good taste—an
eye for color, thoughtful care for the general comfort, a
quick wit, and common sense. Yet these are the safest and
surest helps to the woman who aims to make her home attractive
to the eye and restful to the body.</p>

<p>Let us enter the door of this woman’s house and see what
she allows and what she disallows.</p>

<p>First, we notice that her entry and stairways are planned
upon as liberal a scale as possible. That is but common
sense, for furniture and trunks must go in and out, up and
down, to say nothing of household and visitors, and the
broader the entry way, the more hospitable and inviting it can
be made with chairs, table and sofa. Modern builders have
at last learned this, and they are giving us the old-fashioned
hall again, with a corner or side fireplace, and, if possible, an
outlook on the back garden. This hall is not kept too dark
in winter, nor too light in summer. In cold weather we need
cheerfulness, warmth, and light on entering the house. In
summer we should step from the glare of a vertical sun and
heat of the nineties, into a cool, refreshing shade, kept, of a
purpose, darker than sitting-room, dining-room and kitchen,
to prevent flies from swarming into the hall and up the stairway
and becoming the pest of the morning sleeper. The back
stairs also are closed, either above or below, so that premonitory
hints of meals to come may not ascend to the bedrooms
and go down the front stairs to guests in the parlor, thus proclaiming
on the housetop what you whisper to your cook in
the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Aim at a gold gown and you’ll get a sleeve,” says our
grandmother’s proverb; so our wise woman knows what is
best and aims for it, but contents herself with what she can
get. For an American house, the best flooring, generally
speaking, would be—for a vestibule—tiles of small pattern and
modest color, such as yellow and brown, which would take no
injury from muddy overshoes or dripping umbrellas; for the
rest of the house hard wood floors (Southern pine is admirable),
plain or very simply inlaid. Elaborate patterns in inlaid
woods should be avoided, except in large rooms, and contrasts
of colors, such as stripes of black walnut and hard pine, which
make a narrow hallway look yet narrower; but a modest border
might be inlaid around any room, hall, parlor, or bedroom
with good effect, if desired, with a substantial oriental
rug in the midst of it all. There can be nothing better than
this.</p>

<p>But a cheap pine floor, if properly laid, can be stained and
made to do good service, instead of hard wood, and a strip of
cocoanut matting running the length of the hall is not to be
despised; or, if cracks yawn too perceptibly to have the floor
bare, it can be covered with a plain, self-colored drugget or
carpet filling, or “two ply,” while a strip of bright carpet
passes from the doorway up the stairs, and enlivens the hall.
Or, simpler yet, the floor can be painted a serviceable yellow
or gray, and a width of rag carpet can add warmth and color.
There are pretty straw mattings in greens and reds and cream
colors which, with the aid of rugs, serve admirably for floor
coverings, but they are hardly durable enough for entry ways.
Our wise woman bears in mind that a well-laid, hard wood
floor will outlast many a drugget, or carpet, or coat of paint,
or oil cloth, and she does up her hall floor, at first, in as durable
a fashion as her purse will allow.</p>

<p>There is a certain fitness of things also to be observed.
Good taste forbids her to step from an entry with stained or
painted pine floor and rag carpet to a parlor with inlaid floors
and Persian rugs. The rag carpet of the hall demands something
correspondingly simple in the reception room; a floor
stained or painted in the same fashion, or a straw matting,
with perhaps a few breadths of “Morris” carpet, of warm
color and quiet figure, sewed together to make a rug, and raveled
at the ends for fringe.</p>

<p>As for walls, it is convenient to divide them with a chair rail
or moulding of the same stuff as that used for mop-boards and
door casings, fastened about four feet from the floor and running
around the entry and up the side wall of the stairway.
The wall below this moulding can be painted in oil a warm
olive-brown or green, or a dull red, and, when so painted, can
be washed like the woodwork.</p>

<p>A more expensive way would be to panel off this space with
big cedar shingles of the sort that cost about $25 a thousand,
provided the rest of the woodwork is repainted, or with wood
corresponding with the finish of the room. Unpainted woodwork,
even though made of soft pine, is far better from the
housekeeper’s standpoint than that which is coated with paint.
Pine, when oiled and varnished—not too heavily—assumes a
rarely beautiful hue and shows the variety of its markings to
very good effect. The wall space above could be papered
with some figured pattern corresponding in color with that below
the chair-rail, or dado, as it is called (if that is painted
rather than paneled), but the wall-space should be of lighter
tint than the dado, or it could be calcimined, or <i>kalsomined</i>,
as they spell and pronounce it in New Jersey.</p>

<p>When paper is used, the pattern should not be so large as to
make the room look small, nor so pronounced as to prevent
the walls from serving as a fair back-ground for pictures and
plants.</p>

<p>But suppose our prudent woman can afford neither chair-rail
nor oil-painted dado, and yet would like to divide the wall
space. Then let Mr. Kalsominer paint a dado of olive-brown
or green, a wall space of much lighter shade, and a ceiling of
cream color. He can also paint a band of dull red where the
chair-rail should be, and then our wise woman, if she be also
a woman of faculty, will take the little red paint pot into her
own hand and will cut out of varnished paper some conventional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
leaf or flower, and using this as a stencil, with a stiff
brush she will powder<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> this leaf or flower at regular intervals
of about a foot all over the dado. Or, discarding the stencil,
some simple arrangement of triple dots might be used that
need only be indicated with a pencil point and then painted
on, with a small brush, free hand. The kalsominer would
double his prices if he did it, but the room will be twice as
pretty if she does it herself. Or she may powder her lighter
wall space with figures of the same dark shade as the dado,
so harmonizing the upper and lower portions, while a yet
darker brown line divides them. But the stenciling of a wall
space requires too much step-ladder work for the ordinary
woman. Last, and probably cheapest of all, she may use
wall paper—the darkest shade below—of some stiff diaper or
tile pattern, the lighter above, with border between; the ceiling
being washed a lighter harmonizing color.</p>

<p>As to the furniture of the hall, it ought to begin outside the
door, with a bench, or settle, or chair, at least, upon the
piazza, or “stoop,” for any weary body to drop down upon
while the door is undoing. A wide piazza gives room not only
for a few chairs, and the picturesque and comfortable hammock,
but for a table, as well, where the afternoon cup of tea
can rest, or the work-basket with the weekly mending. A
broad platform with awnings is a comfortable and picturesque
addition to a house of plain and unattractive exterior. Happy
and healthy are the households whose piazzas are their summer
sitting-rooms.</p>

<p>The vestibule should have closets or some very plain and
simple receptacle for umbrellas and India rubber shoes. In
the hall proper comes up the vexed question of the hat tree.
It is an ungainly, aggressive piece of furniture, and very cumbersome.
If possible, let it be done away with. If there is a
closet under the stairs for the family hats and coats, then the
chance visitor can throw off his coat on the hall sofa or table.
Hall chairs are useful, with a box seat holding whisk broom,
hat brush, driving gloves, and things of that sort, and so is the
table drawer; any of these contrivances are better than the
hat tree, and so is a simple rail hidden away in some dark
corner under the stairs, if there be no closet, with pegs attached
for hats and coats. “There can be no reasonable law
against making a hall chair both comfortable and suitable to
its situation. The common Windsor high-backed arm-chair,
made in the same wood as the table, and with a cushion covered
with some bright colored material is well suited for this
purpose; or a chair … with a high back and broad, low
seat looks both severe enough to discourage unbecoming
lounging, and yet sufficiently comfortable to secure a proper
degree of rest for the weary.”</p>

<p>And where in the hall can hangings and stuffs be used to
best advantage? Enter any house and look about for yourself.
If the ground glass of the vestibule door be exposed and
staring, the hall floor bare and cold, the hall chair hard and
stiff, the doors to the reception or sitting-room all closed, rising
black and grim before you, and the hall itself so dark that you
can not see even where to lay down your companionable umbrella,
does there not come over you a chill, as if you were being
repelled by the spirit of inhospitality? The entrance hall
gives you no hearty cheer of welcome. But warm up the floor
with a rug, lay a restful and inviting cushion on the chair;
open the door that leads to the room where the household
gathers, or where your hostess is to receive you, or take it off
the hinges bodily and lay it away, and hang instead a curtain
that shall give a glimpse of the warmth and light within, while
still shutting out the draught. Let soft silk or Madras muslin
hang in full folds over the window in the door, and the stranger
who enters no longer feels like a prisoner in Doubting Castle,
whom Giant Despair has cast into a dungeon for trespassing
on his grounds, but rather shall I not say, as if he had fallen
upon the House Beautiful, built on purpose for the entertainment
of pilgrims, where only the fair virgins Prudence, Piety
and Charity would be his companions?</p>

<p>Just so inviting was the entrance to my wise woman’s house
when I last visited her. It was a house with a door in the
middle, the hall running through the entire depth. Midway,
an arch curtained with Mexican blankets half screened the
back hall, which served for the family music room. Facing
the piano was a long, old-fashioned sofa, where the weary head
of the house could lie and be rested by music from his daughter’s
fingers or the voices of his children. This happy man,
who had his quiver full of them, had one of those charming
houses that grows with the household. Near the side entrance,
what used to be a dining-room is now known as <i>the coat room</i>.
I saw one side of the room literally lined with coats and wraps,
hats and bonnets, depending from some hat rack arrangement
of domestic manufacture. Boots, shoes, and galoches of all
shapes and sizes stood in a suitable rack beneath. Guns and
hunting gear, fishing rods and tackles, bows and arrows, grace
hoops, battle-doors and shuttle-cocks, tennis rackets and croquet
mallets and balls all found their appointed places here.
Water and towels awaited the convenience of those who must
make a partial toilet in haste. Even the shoe-blacking had
its own corner. A book case on the wall held well thumbed
grammars and geographies side by side with dictionaries, college
text-books and a cook book or two; while before the fireplace
that “filled the room on one side,” you might see a
young Nimrod greasing his boots or polishing his gun; and
later, the little folks popping corn, making caramels, or boiling
taffy. When the wise woman, after looking well to the
ways of her household, devises such liberal things as these in
their behalf, no wonder her children rise up and call her
blessed.</p>

<p>The room on which the average American housekeeper expends
the most thought and pains is the parlor, as she calls it.
The word parlor means, primarily, a room for conversation.
Properly speaking, the room where members of the family
gather that they may talk together, is the parlor (from the
French <i>parler</i>), but somehow the word has been applied to
“the best room of a house, kept for receiving company, as distinguished
from the sitting room of the family.” We have an
English word for that—drawing room—contracted from withdrawing
room—a room appropriated for the reception of guests
“to which a company withdraws from the dining room.”
Since the household is more important than the house, the
best of the house should be at the service of the household;
hence whatever is most comfortable and cheerful should be in
the parlor where the family congregate. If aside from the
dining room and kitchen there is but one other room on the
first floor, let that be the parlor for family use, the “living
room,” unless there be a family sitting room on the second
floor.</p>

<p>For people who entertain many guests the reception or withdrawing
room is a necessity, and it is often convenient in city
houses to have, in addition, a smaller room near the door,
where the lady of the house can receive visitors without disturbing
the family party or the friends whom she may be entertaining
in the drawing room.</p>

<p>There is never need of saying to an American housewife, let
the room where you receive your friends be as handsome as
may be. I would rather say let it be as comfortable as you
know how to make it. Do not keep it dark and unwholesome,
stuffy and shut up. If your economical soul refuses to expose
its treasures always to the light of day, at least do your best
to make the room look habitable, and as if it were put into
daily use. What can be more embarrassing to a guest than
to be ushered into a dark room, cold and repellent in winter,
close and stifling in summer, there to wait drearily till the mistress
of the house has donned her good clothes and is ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
to push back the shutter or raise the curtain that she may have
light enough to recognize her guest?</p>

<p>Our English sisters set us a good example in this respect.
Their drawing rooms are made comfortable, with easy chairs
strong enough to hold a man’s weight, with tables conveniently
placed, with books here and an embroidery frame there,
and a lady’s work basket near at hand, not at all too fine for
daily use. I have seen an American lady hustle her work
basket out of the room when the door-bell rang, hide her
thimble in her pocket, and assume an air of elegant idleness
and leisure, as if she were ashamed to be caught needle in
hand. Her English sister, better bred, would lay down her
work to welcome her guest, and resume it again, as a matter
of course, to set her visitor at ease.</p>

<p>A marble-topped center table is not essential to a drawing
room; nor are a photograph album and illustrated books essential
ornaments of the center table. The morning papers,
the last number of <i>The Century</i>, and a readable book are more
attractive ornaments than the most costly album, though filled
with pictures of all the celebrities you have ever seen. I
would have a book case, at least a book-shelf, in every room in
the house—I have three in my hall, even—and the reception
room surely is no exception to the rule. Let there be books at
hand for the entertainment of guests, and let there be every
facility possible for rendering the room light enough to read
or to sew. In a large room there should be more than one
table, and student lamps in abundance where there is no gas.
Where gas is burned there should still be lamps or drop-lights
on the tables. Parsimony in lamp-light is as bad as parsimony
in fuel or in bedding, and results in serious injury to the eyes.
As to the matter of heating our houses, there have been so
many funny things done in the attempt to affect a compromise
between the fire place and the furnace that almost every house
has in it something incongruous in this line. The old-fashioned
fireplace for burning wood was healthful and artistic,
but it often smoked, and in the depth of winter seldom gave
out sufficient heat. The grate in which anthracite coal is
burned, or soft coal, was good, but the care of the coal fire,
though not so continuous as of the wood, was still a heavy
burden. There is a price to pay for every comfort, and we can
not rightly enjoy the comfort without paying its full price.
But that seemed a hard doctrine, and so the inventors went to
work. They gave up that abomination, the air-tight stove,
which rose in grim blackness an offense to the eye, and
parched all the air for us before we had breathed it in. Then
the furnace came in and there was an era of real rejoicing.
Fireplaces were walled up and holes cut in all the floors, but
with hot air furnaces there were new complications. Water
pans which should be replenished daily were as often as not
left empty, and the air was no better to breathe than that
baked dry by an air-tight stove, and the fire, as a rule, required
a man’s hand. Beside, holes in the floor were not inviting to
have around. But the furnace, whether hot air or steam, did
warm the house. Thermometers stood at from seventy to
eighty instead of being kept where they belonged, down in
the sixties, and throat and lung diseases multiplied. Then
some one who had not forgotten the cheer of the fireplace introduced
the hot air from a chimney register, giving out heat,
with no sign of fire, from the old spot, and then came the
make-believe iron logs with an internal gas arrangement
which was lighted when guests came, and burned in a pathetic,
appealing way, provoking the beholder now to laughter and
now to tears.</p>

<p>It was left to the æsthetic craze to bring in the last and
worst affront of all to comfort and common sense, a fireplace
with highly glazed tiles and elaborate wrought iron
back, with choice and costly fenders, tongs, and andirons of
brass and steel, with all the appointments of the fireplace of
the most luxurious stamp, but all too fine for possible use, with
absolutely nothing intended for use. The poor, foolish, iron
logs never deceived any one, but they burned; nevertheless,
these beautifully tiled fireplaces, with their spick and span
hearths are mere husks, and are as loathsome and cluttersome
as are the “air castles” and wax fruit, which these æsthetics
would banish in contempt from their homes. The height of
luxury is to have the sharpness of winter’s cold subdued by a
good furnace in the cellar, which modifies the air all over the
house, and then to have open fires here and there to give cheer
as well as additional warmth and good ventilation, and a fireplace
finished with plain brick, without a tile, the brick work,
freshened up occasionally by painting it with Indian red mixed
with milk, after the fashion of fifty years ago, or a plain iron
grate for coal, used as occasion calls, is in better taste for a
drawing room than the most elaborate combination of tiles,
brass and steel kept for mere show. When any object, not
alone a fireplace, but any object designed primarily for use is
so excessively ornamented as to fail of its mission of utility,
this very excess of decoration becomes an offense and renders
the object neither useful nor beautiful.</p>

<p>Wm. Morris’s stringent rule, “Have nothing in your homes
that you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful,”
applies with full force to the drawing room; and when the
housekeeper has striven first of all to supply her drawing room
with comfortable, useful pieces of furniture, she may look
around her with surprise to find that almost without her
thought the place has grown beautiful as well.</p>

<h3>THE SUN.</h3>

<p>During this month the sun makes rapid strides northward,
moving from declination 22° 57′ south on the 1st to declination
17° 11′ south on the 31st. This occasions also quite an
increase in the length of the day, from sunrise to sunset on the
1st being 9h. 23m. 36s., and on the 30th, 10h. 4m. 56s. On the
1st, 16th and 30th, 7:22, 7:21 and 7:11 a. m. are the respective
hours of rising, and 4:46, 4:59 and 5:16 p. m. the hours of setting.
On the 16th, day breaks at 5:40 a. m., and twilight ends
at 6:40 p. m., giving just thirteen hours between “early dawn
and dewy eve.” The sun is slower than the clock, on the 1st,
being on the meridian at three minutes and thirty-eight seconds
past twelve, and on the 31st reaching the meridian thirteen
minutes and forty-seven seconds after the clock indicates
noon.</p>

<h3>THE MOON</h3>

<p class="unindent">Will present its ordinary four changes at the following times:
last quarter on the 7th, at 10:28 p. m.; new moon, 16th, 3:28 a.
m.; first quarter, 23d, 8:18 p. m.; full, 30th, 11:11 a. m. It will
be in apogee, or farthest from the earth, on the 13th, at 3:42 a.
m., and in perigee, or nearest to the earth, on the 28th, at 8:42
p. m. It will reach its greatest elevation, amounting to 66° 55′,
on the 28th, and the least elevation, 30°, on the 14th.</p>

<h3>MERCURY,</h3>

<p class="unindent">Well named from its mercurial habits, having the smallest
orbit, and being the most rapid traveler, presents in a given
time more phases than any other of the planets. Thus we
find that on the 3d, at 5:00 p. m., it is in inferior conjunction
with the sun, that is, between the earth and the sun; on the
14th, at 8:42 a. m., 2° 1′ south of the moon; on the 14th, at
3:00 p. m., stationary, that is, it is moving in a direct line (or
nearly so) away from the earth, and thus <i>seems</i> to stand still;
on the 24th, at 5:00 a. m., is 1° 6′ north of Venus, on which
occasion the latter will serve as a good “pointer,” enabling
one readily to find this peculiar planet. On the 26th, it is at its
greatest distance (24° 53′) west of the sun. Its motion for the
first fourteen days is 12° 45′ retrograde; and for the remainder
of the month, 29° 51′ 40″ direct. On the 1st it rises at 7:39 a.
m., and sets 5:11 p. m.; and on the 16th, rises at 5:52 a. m., sets
at 3:22 p. m.; and on the 30th rises at 5:52 a. m., and sets at
3:10 p. m.; changing from evening star during the first, to
morning star in the latter part of the month.</p>

<h3>VENUS</h3>

<p class="unindent">Continues morning star, and will remain so till the 4th of May.
On the 1st, rises at 5:11 a. m., sets 2:39 p. m.; on the 16th, rises
at 5:40 a. m., sets 2:52 p. m.; on the 30th, rises at 5:59 a. m.,
sets 3:17 p. m. Motion 41° 32′ 59″ direct. Diameter diminishes
from 12.4″ to 11.2″. On the 13th, at 3:34 p. m., 4° 8′
south of the moon. On the 24th, at 5:00 a. m., 1° 6′ south of
Mercury.</p>

<h3>MARS.</h3>

<p>This planet presents nothing peculiar this month. It will be
an evening star, though appearing but a short time after sunset
each day. On the 1st it rises at 8:10 a. m., and sets at 5:20
p. m.; on the 16th rises at 7:51 a. m., sets at 5:21 p. m.; on the
30th rises at 7:29 a. m., sets at 5:21 p. m. It has a direct motion
of 25° 16′ 2″, and its diameter remains about the same
during the month, namely: 4.2″. On the 16th, at 6:48 p. m.,
is 5° 42′ south of the moon.</p>

<h3>JUPITER</h3>

<p class="unindent">Makes a retrograde motion of 2° 24′ 47″, and is classed as a
morning star, though he shines nearly the entire night, rising
on the 1st at 9:02 p. m., and setting next morning at 10:14 a. m.;
rising on the 16th at 7:59 p. m., setting on the 17th at 9:13 a. m.;
and on the 30th rising at 6:56 p. m. and setting at 8:14 on the
morning of the 31st. An indication that he is approaching the
earth is that his diameter increased from 39.6″ on the 1st to
42.2″ on the 30th. On the 4th, at 7:24 p. m., he is 4° 2′ north
of the moon.</p>

<h3>SATURN</h3>

<p class="unindent">Has a retrograde motion of 1° 31′ 53″, and his diameter decreases
during the month six-tenths of a second of arc; but
this diminution affects but very slightly his brightness. As
he is an evening star, the most convenient opportunities are
afforded for obtaining a fine view. He rises on the 1st at 3:07
p. m., and sets on the 2nd at 5:43 a. m.; on the 15th rises at
2:04 p. m., and sets the following morning at 4:40; on the 30th,
rises at 1:07 p. m., and sets on the 31st at 3:43 a. m. On the
26th, at 9:02 p. m., is 3° 27′ north of the moon.</p>

<p>The use of the telescope in developing the rings of Saturn
is one of the interesting items in astronomical history. To one
looking at this planet with the naked eye, he appears simply
as a bright star; but to a person using a telescope of moderate
power, he now presents some such appearance as was hinted
at in the December number of <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>, and resembles
a globe with an appendage on either side similar to a
new moon (the concave part turned toward the globe). To the
early astronomers, whose telescopes were so much inferior to
ours, his appearance was a great puzzle and produced a great
variety of opinions. To Galileo the planet appeared like
three globes, a large one with a smaller detached one on each
of two sides. To Scheiner, in 1614, he appeared as one large
globe, with a small attached ball on either side. To others he
appeared as a globe with crescents (shape of new moon) sometimes
detached, and at other times having their cusps (sharp
points) meet on the edge of the planet. And it was not until
1655 that the discovery was made that these appendages were
neither balls nor crescents, but were, as then supposed, a ring
(seen in various positions) around the body of the planet. In
the spring of this year, Huyghens discovered that what had
appeared as handles extended out on each side and were somewhat
like a veritable ball with its projecting axes ready to be
laid in their “bearings.” The next spring the “gudgeons” had
disappeared and only the plain sphere remained. In the fall
of 1656 the axes had reappeared. Thus was suggested to Huyghens
that these appearances were produced by the alternate
presentation to view of the edge and face of a ring, whose
thickness was so small as to be invisible when its plane was
directed to the eye. Being anxious to secure to himself the
honor of this discovery, and yet not wishing to publish it prematurely,
lest his conception should turn out to be incorrect,
he printed at the end of a little pamphlet descriptive of the
planet the following characters: <i>aaaaaaa ccccc d eeeee g h iiiiiii
llll mm nnnnnnnnn oooo pp q rr s ttttt uuuuu</i>. Should
his theory prove to be incorrect no one would be likely to solve
the riddle; should it be correct, as it proved to be, he readily
arranged the letters to read: <i>Annulo cingitur tenui, plano nusquam
cohaerente, ad eclipticam inclinato</i>; which being translated
means: “Girdled by a thin, plane ring, nowhere touching,
inclined to the ecliptic.” It was soon ascertained that the
ring had an inclination of 27° to the plane of its orbit, and as
it with the planet revolves about the sun, its axis maintains the
same absolute position; so that as the revolution is made once
in every twenty-nine and a half years, every fourteen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
three-fourth years its edge is directly toward the sun, and,
practically, toward the earth (since the distance of the
earth from the sun is comparatively small), and is invisible
except through the most powerful telescopes. In like manner,
every fourteen and three-fourth years the greatest
possible portion of the ring’s surface is presented to the
sun, and if the ring were perpendicular to the plane of the
earth’s orbit, and its axis directed toward the earth, we should
see the globe entirely girdled, instead of seeing, as we do, a
large portion of one side of the ring and the opening only on
two sides between it and the planet.</p>

<p>After Huyghens, the discovery was made by an English astronomer
named Ball, that instead of only one ring, Saturn
had two rings, divided by a narrow, dark line, and that the inner
ring was broader than the outer in about the ratio of seventeen
to ten; that is, the breadth of the inner was estimated
to be 17,000 miles, while that of the outer was only 10,300
miles. In 1850, Prof. Bond, of Cambridge, discovered a third
ring lying between the inner ring and the planet. But this was
hardly regarded as a discovery, as this ring had been “seen in
England by Messrs. Lassell and Dawes, before it was formally
announced by the Bonds;” and “something of the same kind
had been seen by Dr. Galle, at Berlin, as far back as 1838.”</p>

<p>Another perplexing question is, whether there are changes
going on in these rings, and if so, what they are. Struve, in
1851, propounded the theory that the inner edge of the ring
(or rings) was gradually contracting, and thus lessening the
space between it and the planet, and this at the rate of about
1.3″ per century; at which rate it would close in on the
planet about the year 2150—a date at such a distance that the
event, should it transpire, will be of little moment to our
readers.</p>

<p>Another not yet satisfactorily answered question is, of what
are these rings composed? The generally accepted answer at
present is, that it is neither a solid nor a fluid ring, but a cloud
of satellites, too small and too numerous to be seen singly.
“They are like the separate little drops of water out of which
are composed fogs and clouds, which, to our eyes, seem like
solid masses.”</p>

<h3>URANUS</h3>

<p class="unindent">Reaches his stationary point on the 6th, at 5:00 p. m., having
made a direct motion of 51.45″; during the rest of the month
he retrogrades 17′ 12.6″. On the 6th, at 6:50 p. m., he is 1° 18′
north of the moon. He figures as a morning star, rising on
Dec. 31st, ’84, at 11:29 p. m., and setting on New Year’s at
11:25 a. m.; on the 15th, rising at 10:30 p. m., and setting on
the 16th at 10:26 a. m.; on the 29th, rising at 9:33 p. m., and
setting on the 30th at 9:31 a. m.</p>

<h3>NEPTUNE</h3>

<p class="unindent">Also plays the <i>rôle</i> of morning star, rising in the afternoon of
the 1st at 1:31, and setting on the morning of the 2d at
3:25; on the 16th, rising at 12:31 p. m., and setting next morning
at 2:25; and on the 30th, rising at 11:36 a. m., and setting
at 1:30 a. m. on the 31st. On the 24th, at 11:34 p. m., he is 1°
48′ north of the moon; is stationary at 3:00 a. m. on the 30th,
up to which date he has retrograded 14′ 51.6″. His diameter
being only 2.6″, he can only be seen through a telescope of
higher power.</p>

<h2 id="YALE_COLLEGE_AND_YALE_CUSTOMS">YALE COLLEGE AND YALE CUSTOMS.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">BY GEORGE H. VINCENT.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>The good people who, in 1638, came over from England and
settled New Haven, came with a definite purpose. They
aimed to establish a model community in church and state,
and, as an important means to this end, they proposed to
found a college. At first, events conspired to keep the classic
groves from taking root on the bleak Connecticut shore. A
capricious government in England was granting and annulling
charters with alarming frequency, and the colonies were in a
corresponding state of uncertainty and apprehension, while
the ravages of the Indian wars did much to occupy and distract
the thoughts of the New Haven people. Finally, in 1660,
a bequest of Governor Hopkins induced the colonists to found
an institution which they called a “Collegiate School,” lest a
more pretentious title might make it difficult to obtain a charter.
The Governor’s will, however, was contested by the legislature,
which finally obtained a part of the bequest. This
fact, together with the depression caused by the compulsory
union of New Haven with the Connecticut colony, prevented
any marked advance in the prosperity of the institution which,
under the title of the “Hopkins Grammar School,” still prepares
students for the various departments of Yale.</p>

<p>After the peace of Ryswick in 1697, prosperity returned to
the colonists, and a second time the subject of a college was
agitated. Ten trustees, most of them ministers from New
Haven and vicinity, met some time in 1700 at Brandford, a
small town near New Haven. Each trustee presented a few
volumes with the declaration: “I give these books for the
founding of a college.”</p>

<p>The next year a charter was granted to the new college,
which was located at Saybrook, with the Rev. Abraham Pierson,
a metaphysician of some note, as president. The students,
eight in number, and “put into classes according to
the proficiency they had antecedently made,” lived in the
president’s house, under his supervision and instruction. The
first commencement was held at Saybrook, September 13,
1702.</p>

<p>The French war of the same year had its effect upon the
college, and when in 1707 Rector Pierson died, it was found
impossible to support a resident professor at Saybrook. Consequently
the senior class was sent to Milford and placed under
the Rev. Samuel Andrew, while the other classes remained
at Saybrook with two tutors. At this time Yale College extended
from the senior class at Milford to the juniors, sophomores
and freshmen at Saybrook, a distance of forty miles.</p>

<p>In 1714, the death of the Rev. James Pierpont, who may be
regarded as the founder of the college, struck another blow at
its prosperity. At the same time complaints about their accommodations
from the Saybrook students made it evident
that if the college was to become a permanent institution, some
active measures were required. At a meeting of trustees in
1716, after a protracted discussion, and not a little to the dissatisfaction
of Hartford, it was decided to locate the college
permanently at New Haven. Hartford was appeased by
building there a new court house, and the scattered students
were gathered at New Haven, which that day became a college
town.</p>

<p>Among several donations to the college, the most generous
was that of Elihu Yale, a former resident of New Haven, and
at the time a wealthy London merchant. In view of his munificence,
the trustees called the new building which his donation
had enabled them to complete, Yale College.</p>

<p>It would be superfluous for our purpose to trace the history
of the college from this permanent foundation in 1718 to the
present time. Among its presidents we find such names as
Elihu Williams, Ezra Stiles, Timothy Dwight, Jeremiah Day,
Theodore D. Woolsey and Noah Porter—grand men of the
orthodox school, some of them rigid and severe in administration,
but all respected and honored. The character of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
presidents is an index to the institution, which has developed
under the severe discipline of New England. The students
who of late years have come from distant states have modified
the general character of the college, but have not destroyed
the old influence. The recognition of religion, which in some
universities has well-nigh disappeared, still holds its own, and
the same bell which, in years gone by, summoned sleepy and
half-dressed students to the murky chapel, at five in the
morning, now, at a more convenient hour, assembles in the
handsome “Battell” those who have come to college from
every state in the Union. Thus the old New England <i>régime</i>
makes an impression upon the rising generation of the whole
country.</p>

<p>It is not within the scope of this article to consider the development
of the college curriculum; but, perhaps, in view of
the radical changes which the Yale faculty have introduced
for the college year 1884-’85, it may not be out of place rapidly
to sketch the innovations. In 1786 the requirements for admission
were “Virgil, Tully, and the Greek Testament.” This
is characteristic of the college, which has always been remarkably
conservative in its devotion to the classics. Charles
Francis Adams’ oration at the Harvard “Phi Beta Kappa”
dinner two years ago, aroused no little antagonism in New
Haven. President Porter has written several articles defending
the classics, and when Matthew Arnold and Lord Coleridge
addressed the Yale students, both congratulated the institution
upon its attitude toward the ancient languages. Heretofore
Latin and Greek have been compulsory during both
freshman and sophomore years. But under the new system
German and French may be substituted for a portion of the
classics. To the senior and junior classes even greater liberty
is given. They are offered between twenty and thirty
elective courses; so that now, instead of turning a whole class
out of the same mould, the college permits men to select those
studies which they find attractive, or which will best prepare
them for their pursuits in life. Thus in one year Yale has
made very rapid strides, and now stands a “golden mean”
between the conservatism of the past and the rashly radical
tendencies of the present. So much for the origin and curriculum
of Yale.</p>

<p>It is not the instruction alone that makes a college course
desirable. The associations, friendships, and experiences in
the college community are also important factors. It has
been well said that a college is a miniature world, with its successes,
failures, and temptations as real as those of the world
without.</p>

<p>It is impossible, in an article like the present, to do more
than give a few of the peculiarities of Yale. The writer disclaims
any attempt to analyze critically the influences and tendencies
of the college, but aims merely to present a few facts
concerning its students, buildings, class spirit, and every-day
life.</p>

<p>The college catalogue shows that in the academic department
the classes average one hundred and fifty students. In
the Sheffield Scientific School the aggregate number is about
two hundred and twenty-five. The other departments swell
the total to between ten and eleven hundred. It is probably
unnecessary to state that co-education is not “dreamed of”
in the Yale philosophy. The warm affection which the faculty
feel for the dead languages seems only to increase their coldness
toward the gentler sex.</p>

<p>Yale is eminently a cosmopolitan institution. When two
years ago state clubs were being formed at Yale, some one
remarked that if the same experiment were attempted at Harvard,
there would be two clubs, one from Boston, and one from
the rest of Massachusetts. While this statement is by no
means true, it suggests the sectional character of the other
New England colleges. A few figures will sustain this claim.
In 1883-’84, out of 824 students in the academic and scientific
departments, only twenty-nine per cent. were from Connecticut.
There were nineteen men from California, six from Colorado,
seven from Georgia, fifty-one from Illinois, thirty-three from
Ohio, twenty from Missouri, and sixty-five from Pennsylvania.
Almost every state, and many of the territories, were represented,
and the very fact that Yale draws its men from so
many widely different sources has an important influence upon
the character of the students. The swift-coursing, tingling
blood of the West is infused into the old, staid, New England
institution, which restrains, modifies, and directs it. The enthusiasm
of Yale is due in a great measure to this western
element. There is a whole-heartedness about Yale students
which you will find in no other eastern institution. Nor is
money at Yale the basis of social standing. A man may command
any position which he has the character or ability to
attain.</p>

<p>It is generally supposed that in a large institution the numbers
in a class prevent that personal contact with the instructors
which smaller classes afford. This objection can be
easily answered. Let us suppose that a freshman class numbers
one hundred and fifty students, and that the curriculum
includes five studies. The class will be divided into five sections
of thirty men each, and will recite to five instructors in
order. There are fifteen recitations a week, so that every
member of the class recites three times a week to each of these
instructors, and that, too, in a class of only thirty. This affords
all the “contact” that either instructors or instructed
need or desire. The divisions are arranged according to excellence
in scholarship at the end of every term, so that each
division has its own standard of attainment; hence the diligent
are not retarded by their more leisurely classmates. Recitations
and examinations are marked upon a scale of four.
When one’s average standing falls below two, he is given the
choice between leaving college or entering the class next below.
This unpleasant experience is known as being “dropped.”
For irregularities and tardiness in attendance, the penalties
are inflicted in the form of “marks,” which have no influence
upon scholarship standing. The penalty for “cutting” chapel
on a week day is two marks, on Sunday, eight. As these
marks accumulate, parents are informed by “letters home”
when a certain limit is approached, which varies in the different
years—more latitude being granted to seniors and juniors
than is enjoyed by the lower classes. For seniors, the first
letter comes at thirty marks; the second at about fifty; and
the third, if there be one, informs the parent that his son has
incurred sixty marks, and has been suspended for six weeks.
This is “rustication.” The unfortunate retires to Milford,
where he pursues his studies in interesting solitude. This
marking system has many “defects,” which are especially
patent to the down-trodden student, but it certainly has the
merit of securing method and regularity in college duties.
Other colleges, notably Amherst, have adopted new methods
for which they claim great superiority over the archaic system.
But it is safe to say that the Yale faculty must be thoroughly
converted before they will discard the old system, which has
been for years the bone of contention in every Yale debating
club.</p>

<p>We come now to speak of the material world of Yale—its
buildings and campus. Architecturally, Yale is inferior to
both Harvard and Princeton. There are between thirty and
forty buildings connected with Yale University; but on the
college campus there are sixteen. Six of these are dormitories,
occupied exclusively by members of the academic department,
or Yale College proper. Four of these dormitories, together
with three other buildings, the “Athenæum,” “Lyceum,” and
“Old Chapel,” extend in a line along the east side of the
campus, and constitute the “old brick row.” The dormitories
are called “south,” “south middle,” “north middle,” and
“north,” and are separated by the three recitation buildings
mentioned above. “South middle,” erected in 1750, is the
oldest building on the campus. Until within a few years, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
was reserved for the use of the sophomore class, and many a
trembling freshman has had his first experience of hazing
within its ancient walls. The faculty concluded, however, that
they would best consult the interests of good order and education
by razing this sophomore stronghold. “South middle,”
thoroughly renovated, is to-day as quiet as the seniors’ retreat—“South.”
Durfee Hall, at the north end of the campus, is a
handsome dormitory of brown stone, accommodating eighty
students. Farnam Hall is a modern building of brick, furnishing
rooms for an equal number. Battell Chapel, on the
north-eastern corner of the campus, is a large stone building
with a seating capacity of eight or ten hundred. Its walls
contain many handsome memorial windows, and in one of its
towers are the clock and chimes. Graduate’s Hall is a massive
brown stone building, presenting the general appearance of a
feudal castle. It is, in fact, the stronghold of the college, and
must be taken several times during the course—it is the examination
hall. Next comes the Library, a gothic building with
low wings on either side. It is a repository for some one hundred
and seventy-five thousand volumes. The Art School is
one of the most expensive buildings on the campus. It is of
brown stone, and, like the library, is overgrown with ivy
planted by graduating classes. The Art School contains
excellent collections of paintings, marbles, and casts, together
with several studios and class rooms. The other buildings,
known as “Old Lab.,” “Cabinet,” and “Treasury” are, it is
to be hoped, as useful as they are unattractive. So much for
the campus proper. Near by are the new Sloane Physical
Laboratory, the gymnasium, and the Peabody Museum, which
even in its present incomplete state is one of the largest
buildings in New Haven. The collections are excellent, being
especially complete in the departments of mineralogy and
palæontology. Within the radius of a few squares are the
Sheffield Scientific School, the Divinity School, and the departments
of Law and Medicine.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to the composition of the college community.
The four classes are separated by very clearly defined
lines. While, of course, there are many friendships between
men of different classes, as a rule men associate exclusively
with their own classmates. When it is remembered that a
class averages one hundred and fifty men, one explanation of
this clannishness is obvious. It takes four years for a student
to know his classmates, and among them he will find all the
friends he needs. Until within the last year or two the elective
system, which brings members of different classes into the
same recitation room, has not been in operation, and men
have always recited with their classmates exclusively. Another
prominent reason for class feeling, as it is called, is
found in athletic rivalry. Let one attend a class boat race,
hear the shouting, observe the ecstacy of delight with which
the winners carry their crew on their shoulders from the boat,
and he will begin to understand the real significance of class
spirit. This class spirit is warmest between the two lower
classes, where the friction is greatest. Just here we may refer
to hazing and rushing, which are objects of so much popular
misapprehension. That in early years freshmen were subjected
to rough, and often brutal treatment, can not be denied.
But that order of things has passed away, together with early
chapel and biennial examinations. A “rush” is nothing
more than an attempt of freshmen and sophomores, arranged
in solid phalanxes, to force each other back. Such a thing as
a decision on a rush is unknown, and the whole affair has the
advantage of leaving both sides assured of a “most decisive
and brilliant victory.” Hazing is confined to the first few
weeks of the term, and is harmless, not to say puerile, in its
character. Sophomores wander about the streets, admonishing
freshmen to “put out” their lights. If these commands are
not complied with, the hazers ascend to the room of the audacious
freshman, quiz him awhile, and then put him to bed,
where he stays until his persecutors have left, when he resumes
his interrupted tasks. The whole thing is a farce, and
can not last much longer. Although the custom may be childish,
it certainly is not the pernicious thing which the press
would have the public believe.</p>

<p>Athletics have a very prominent place in the college world.
Youthful vitality finds a safety valve in athletic exercises.
Inter-collegiate rivalry is a most natural thing. University
foot ball teams, crews and ball nines follow as a matter of
course. These contests are of absorbing interest, and are
eagerly anticipated. Alumni of many years’ standing are carried
away with enthusiasm at a college match. The public is
led to suppose that athletics monopolize the student’s thought
and interest. It is true that students do talk of a ball match
more frequently than of Greek particles. The one belongs to
the recreative side of college life, the other to the recitation
room. When relieved from his regular duties, the normal
student seeks recreation. Beside affording exercise, athletics
engender a college spirit which helps to bind together the Yale
alumni all over the land. Whatever may be the excesses, the
advantages are manifold. The faculty declare that athletics
have never been more prominent, nor the standard of scholarship
higher than at the present time.</p>

<p>One trace, at least, of the good, old, puritanic days is found
in “compulsory prayers.” At seven every morning, except
Sunday, when there are regular services at 10:30, the old
bell in the lyceum tower disturbs the peacefully slumbering
student. At eight it gives a second warning, and at about
seven minutes after it rings again, until, tolling the last minute,
it stops at 8:10 precisely. The students who have been dropping
in one by one since eight, come in increasing numbers as
the time approaches. As the bell and organ voluntary cease,
a few stragglers drop into their seats. If it is the last of the
term, there are often a few men who, having only two marks
between them and the cold world, appear in conspicuously
superficial toilets.</p>

<p>The chapel has two transepts, one occupied by the juniors,
the other by the sophomores. The seniors fill the seats on
either side of the center aisle; while the freshmen are consigned
to the gloomy region under the rear gallery. The deportment
of the students during chapel exercises is, without
exception, dignified and respectful. President Porter reads a
selection from the scriptures and announces four verses of a
hymn, which are sung by the choir. Then follows the “long
prayer,” during which almost every head is bowed. It can
not be denied, however, that many a lesson is rapidly scanned
during this part of the devotions. At the close of the prayer
all stand until the president and instructors have left the building.
The seniors face the center aisle, and as the president
passes make a low bow, bringing the body into a horizontal
position. The effect from the galleries is ludicrous, and affords
visitors no little amusement. Immediately after prayers
the classes repair to their recitation rooms. Although compulsory
prayers are not universally popular, yet if regarded
merely as a means of securing regularity, and, by assembling
the classes, of fostering a spirit of college unity, they are undeniably
valuable.</p>

<p>It would not do to describe Yale customs and neglect the
“fence.” The uninitiated can not read of the “fence” and its
traditions without a smile. To one who has not been a member
of the Yale world, the customs of the fence seem as ridiculous
as the antics and gambols of brokers on ’change. But
having once, as a freshman, felt the joy of balancing on that
“fence,” after defeating the Harvard freshman at base ball;
as sophomore having displayed the wonders of the tailor’s art
from the next higher division of the same perch; as junior
having sung there the college songs, and watched the people
“pass on the other side of the way,” and at last, as senior,
having parted from one’s classmates there, the Yale “fence”
must be to him more than any other dingy-brown, two-railed
old structure can be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>Among several privileges which are withheld from the freshman
when he begins his course, is that of sitting on the “fence.”
Most readers would not regard this in the light of a serious
privation. But such it really seems to the new comer. As
soon as the Yale freshmen defeat the Harvard freshmen at
base ball, they are rewarded by being permitted to sit on the
freshmen fence. A man on taking his seat in the United
States Senate can not feel any more real satisfaction than a Yale
freshman perched for the first time on the “fence we’ve won.”</p>

<p>One of the most amusing exercises of commencement time
is the presentation of the sophomore fence to the freshmen.
A sophomore makes the speech of presentation, to which a
freshman replies. These speeches are often bright and witty,
and are received with great applause.</p>

<p>The “fence” is the forum, the market place of the college.
Here appointments are made. It is here you look for a student
before you seek him in his room. Here in the twilight,
and far into the beautiful evenings of May and June, you may
hear the college songs—now a lively air or snatch of opera;
now a warble, loud and clear; again, some plaintive plantation
melody. This is the time when the magic of the fence is
most potent in its influence. There are more romantic things
with which to associate the delightful memories of college life,
perhaps, but nothing can bring a pleasanter throng of recollections
to the Yale alumnus than the mention of the fence.</p>

<p>Fond as they are of being “on the fence,” Yale men are by
no means undecided or vacillating. Yale is a positive institution,
strong, orthodox, and conservative. Its alumni are
prominent not so much in letters as in the affairs of state.
Yale College is yearly sending out into the world enthusiastic,
practical, sensible young fellows to strive, as the grand old
song has it,</p>

<p class="center">BY M. EMILE BLANCHARD.</p>

<p class="center smaller">Translated for <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span> from the <i>Révue des Deux Mondes</i>.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>During a long cycle of years, upon the land called New
Zealand, there were no inhabitants more powerful than gigantic
eagles and moas, enormous birds now extinct. At some indeterminate
time men landed upon these desolate shores; being,
doubtless, unable to return to their point of departure,
and, perhaps, finding the country an asylum, they remained
there. They were Melanesians, men of dark color, and of
coarse hair, like those who inhabited the archipelago in the
western part of the Pacific, put down upon the maps as Melanesia.</p>

<p>Later came people from Polynesia, of whom all tradition is lost.
At a time, the date of which can be approximately fixed, some
canoes reached this land whose occupants declared that they
came from Hawaïki, probably Hawaii. Afterward, in the first
relations of the Europeans with these inhabitants, they were
quickly satisfied that the leading races were of Polynesian origin,
though in some parts all the races were so intermingled
that it was hard to distinguish them. These better developed
classes were known under the name of the Maoris. These
people, full of treachery, robbers without shame, barbarians of
a remarkable intelligence, able to construct fishing utensils,
fine canoes, implements of warfare, and even to sculpture rude
figures and to design ornaments which indicated a certain artistic
taste, inclined to observation enough to attach a name to all
objects which fell under their notice, appeared to the first European
voyagers to their land as a people that could be easily
civilized.</p>

<p>They were in general of tall figure, and had regular features;
their small, jet black eyes were always in motion. According
to an artist who has traveled nearly round the world, the young
men would serve well as models for a statue of Hercules. The
women were well formed, had beautiful eyes and an abundance
of black hair. Their faces looked quite intelligent, and
even possessed a certain grace.</p>

<p>Former explorers tried to find out what religious sentiments,
what superstitions, reigned among these people; they sought
to gather up their traditions. Owing to their idiomatic language
the information was derived slowly and only after great
effort. In the midst of a people presenting the spectacle of
primitive life it is impossible not to take a lively interest in their
belief touching the origin and the final destiny of man. Many
of their ideas on these subjects present a striking similarity to
those prevailing among civilized people.</p>

<p>They have a long mythological history concerning the migrations
of several distinguished ancestors. The life of one of
these in its beginning is of peculiar interest. At his birth his
mother, seeing that he was very feeble, put him in a little skiff
which she placed upon the sea. The winds and the waves
rocked him. He was finally wafted ashore, and found and cared
for by a woman in high authority. His after life was full of
wonderful and supernatural deeds. Then comes an age of
heroes. These at death were deified and shone as stars in the
heavens. Their brilliancy was greater or less according to
their deeds of valor.</p>

<p>In the cosmogony of these New Zealanders the earth is a
plain, the heavens an opaque body extending around it, separated
from it by a transparent substance. They supposed that
the sun and moon glided on the outside of this crystal-like appearance.
Above is the reservoir of the rain, higher the
haunts of the winds, higher still the dwelling of spirits, then
that of light, and then the highest region, the abode of the
greatest of all the gods.</p>

<p>They recognized a multitude of divinities, and accorded to
each one a special function. They occasionally presented offerings
to the gods, in order to render them propitious.</p>

<p>They did not anticipate any pain nor any recompense in the
future life. After death souls, having remained three days
near the bodies which they had abandoned, took themselves
to the extreme north of New Zealand, in order to take their
last plunge into eternal night, or into glory.</p>

<p>As to their customs, scholars say that among the Maoris
the family existed, the tribe, and, in a certain rude sense,
the nation. Under ordinary circumstances the people lived
independent of one another. Upon great occasions the chief
called together the tribes under his sway. He had, however,
the power to declare war or peace, or to dispose of any question
of interest to the public, only with the consent of his people.
There was little distinction in regard to rank among them.
The practice of tattooing themselves prevailed largely, especially
among the warriors.</p>

<p>They had a custom of flattening the noses of the boys and
bandaging their knees and the lower part of the legs, in order
to make them smaller. Thus they manifested the æsthetic sentiment.
The hands of the girls were bound in such a way as
to render them more skillful, in their estimation, in separating
and weaving the fibers of the plant which affords the famous
linen of New Zealand.</p>

<p>Eight days after the birth of a child it underwent a sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
baptismal ceremony. The marriage relation was observed.
At the death of an individual the whole tribe assembled, and
from time to time uttered loud cries, expressive of their grief.
The relatives cut off their hair.</p>

<p>By their work the Maoris excited the surprise of their first
civilized visitors. They displayed remarkably inventive minds,
struggling under the most restricted resources. The necessary
work was divided between the men and women very much
after the manner of our times. The men built the houses,
constructed canoes, cultivated the earth, carved their rude ornaments,
and went hunting and fishing. The women prepared
the food, spun the linen, and wove the cloth. Their language
was well adapted to oratorical effects. There were fourteen
letters in the alphabet; each syllable ended in a vowel, whence
resulted a singularly harmonious speech. They had many
proverbs bearing a striking analogy to many used throughout
Europe. For instance, they said: “One may avoid the point
of a lance, but not a slander;” also, “One may in time learn
all the nooks and corners of any house, but never those of the
heart.” In their assemblies the most eloquent exercised a
great influence, and gave proofs of a remarkable memory in
reciting with great effect proverbs, songs and poems, capable
of producing a great impression upon their auditors.</p>

<p>The exploits of heroes were only perpetuated by these frequent
recitals. Whenever any notable event occurred it became
the motive power of some improvisation. They entertained
themselves as people in Europe do, by all sorts of
amusements, especially dancing. Certain dances were engaged
in by the women alone, others by the men; but in most the
men and women danced together. The women had for their
especial amusement the <i>tangi</i>, or scene of despair. They
feigned the deepest grief, wrung their hands, and uttered the
most heart-rending cries, while tears flowed in abundance.
A stranger moved at the sight always learned with surprise that
it was simply a pastime, and reproached himself for having
misplaced his sympathy. Whenever a visitor presented himself,
the mode of salutation was for the host to rub his nose
against the nose of his guest. Small baskets of provisions
were brought in, and a cordial invitation given to the visitor
to join in partaking of the refreshments.</p>

<p>But these people, hard, cruel, without pity in the execution
of vengeance, but of a quick intelligence and unquestioned
bravery, industrious and ingenious, cultivating a rude kind of
art and of poetry, have been crushed in their struggles with
the Europeans. The descendants of the fierce New Zealand
warriors, as prisoners in certain districts which the English
colonists have promised to respect, live sad and miserable,
hating the plunderers of their land. At the present time they
are scattered by families over the island, nearly always at a
distance from the colonies. Each year this population diminishes;
in the near future they will have entirely disappeared.
Soon there will live only the memory of an extinct race.</p>

<p>But while this is true of the Maoris, the English colonists,
masters of the country, exceedingly prosperous, occupy all the
places possessing the greatest advantages.</p>

<p>Important cities have been built upon the most desirable
locations, both on the sea coast and river banks. Vast agricultural
districts are now tilled. New Zealand has become a
European country, where the population lives with no fear of
the original inhabitants. It is a dependency of England, a
colony which since its formation has made great progress.
The mildness of the climate, the fertility of the soil, the extent
of its forests, the presence of the best materials for industrial
occupations, the independence and safety which an insular
position gives have marked this island as a privileged region.
New Zealand comprises two islands, separated from each other
by Cook’s Straits; they are distinguished as North Island and
South Island. The development of the country since the occupation
by the English has been remarkable. At the commencement
of 1881 there remained only 36,000 Maoris; the
colonial population numbered 500,910. Some of its cities have
acquired considerable importance. Dunedin, in South Island,
has 42,794 inhabitants, and Auckland, in North Island, the
ancient capital, 30,952; Wellington, the present capital, 20,536.
In 1881 there were about 1,310 miles of railroad built, and
about 3,000 miles of telegraph lines. The revenues of the government
amounted to nearly $18,036,000, and the expenses to
$17,644,000. The exportation was valued at $15,212,000, and
the precious metals at $5,602,000. There are on the island
100,000 horses, 500,000 cattle, and 10,000,000 sheep, yielding
great profit. Ships cross from Canterbury in the eastern part
of the country to London in forty days.</p>

<p>The linen produced on the island affords a fine branch of
industry, and the colonies send it to London, receiving for it
not less than $6,000 or $8,000 per year. Trees of the coniferous
order furnish a quantity of gum or resin, which is an important
source of revenue. The commerce carried on in grain,
woods and fats is very great. In the whole country the abundance
of combustible material constitutes a great source of
wealth. Beside its fine forests, it has numerous coal fields.
Petroleum is found in several places, and the colonists affirm
that it is inferior in no respect to that found in the United
States.</p>

<p>Gold districts are so extensive and productive that a great
part of the population is engaged in them. Then add that
silver, mercury, copper, lead, manganese, antimony, and
iron exist in abundance. They are as reserves of public fortune
to the colony. This country has had the rare good fortune
of having already among its inhabitants distinguished
scientific men who have explored the region for the greater
profit of the new society, and for the interests of those who are
occupied with the general knowledge of the globe. The Institute
of New Zealand was founded at Auckland in 1868. Its
members proposed to have for their use museums and public
libraries, and to disseminate by all means possible, instruction
relative to questions of art, of science, and of literature. When
the capital was moved to Wellington the Institute was also
transferred. Since its opening it has published every year a
great volume filled with reports and communications of deep
interest in regard to the ancient inhabitants of the country, the
fauna and the flora, the geology and mineralogy and economy.
It is a valuable work on the natural history of this region of
the world.</p>

<p>The decline, the oppression, almost the annihilation of one
race of mankind has been seen here. We may see now upon
the same soil, rising to prominence, men of another race who
talk of liberty for themselves, and are preparing for a long and
glorious future for their descendants.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p>Royal favors skip from small to great and back again by no
law of ethics or æsthetics, and if we flatter ourselves that we
can account for the choice of some candidates for the poet’s
pension we shall certainly find our wits tested in search of a
philosophy to apply to Charles II., who, with equal felicity,
placed the crown on the geniusless Davenant and the immortal
Dryden.</p>

<p>John Dryden, with all his faults of verse and purpose, was
the genius of his age, and remains one of the five names that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
star the diadem of English song. In circumstances that
tended to enervate rhyme, at a time when the rebound from
Puritanism paid a premium on license and licentiousness,
when no element in national life had the electrical currents to
stimulate literary, least of all poetic genius, John Dryden had
the skill to attune the age in which he lived to a melodious key
that harmonizes with Chaucer, Spenser, Shakspere and Milton.</p>

<p>In character and record he is inexplicable. Born in the
erratic days of Cromwell he is the most heartily English of all
her “men of letters;” of strictest Puritan training, he died a
devout Romanist; of cleanly life and chaste conversation, his
verses are morally reckless; educated at Cambridge, where he
remained for a seven years’ post-graduate course, he was noted
for disloyalty to his <i>Alma Mater</i>; never wrote a line in praise
of it, but went out of his way to endorse its rival—Oxford—to
whom he owed nothing.</p>

<p>It was his unanticipated loyalty to royalty that led Charles
II. to appoint him laureate to succeed Davenant, at the
same time creating a post of literary honor and financial
profit—historiographer—receiving £100 for each position.
His honors cost him dearly in public favor. It was currently
believed that he renounced the cause of the people for court
favors, and Puritanism for self-advancement, and for a score of
years he lost in popularity all that he won of financial ease
and royal distinction.</p>

<p>His greatness consisted in the sublime tact with which he
used the opportunity that disfavor brought him to immortalize
himself in verse.</p>

<p>The Duke of Buckingham, the people’s favorite, ridiculed
the laureate in scathing rhyme, which called forth vociferous
applause from all the lesser poets whom envy and jealousy led
to bitter hatred of the favorite of the court.</p>

<p>Dryden had the grit and genius to hurl the masterpiece of
his age at the whole range of critics under the title of “Absalom
and Achitophel,” and by sheer superiority of brilliancy
and wit dethroned Buckingham and seated himself on the
throne of popular favor. A specimen of his characterization
may not be amiss.</p>

<p>Dryden was the first well-paid poet England ever had. For
the translation of his fables he received £300, while for translating
Virgil he received the fabulous sum of £1,200.</p>

<p>His most distinguished poem is his “Ode to St. Cecilia,”
which he wrote at the age of seventy, at a single all-night sitting.
In the evening hour the thought occurred to him and he
could not drop his pen until at dawn the last word was on paper.</p>

<p>Wordsworth could not love Dryden, because there is not an
image in all his poetry suggested by nature. While Chaucer
seems to have been always out of doors, Dryden apparently
never knew there was any out of doors. He could not create,
could not be pathetic, but in power of argument, in satirical
skill, in “declamatory magnificence,” he is without a peer in
the language.</p>

<p>Thomas Shadwell, “mature in dullness from his tender
years,” who only lives through the grace of Dryden’s crucifying
satire, by a fortune no art can explain enjoyed the laurel
that had decked the brow of Dryden for a generation. Without
poetic merit he was skillful as a hater, shrewd as a schemer;
he missed no opportunity to make Dryden wince until he made
himself acknowledged as his rival, and when William and
Mary ascended the throne the only way they could effectively
snub the royalty they supplanted was to transfer the laurel
from Dryden to Shadwell, who owed all the fame he ever enjoyed
to his artful drawing of Dryden’s fire.</p>

<p>It is too bad that William and Mary were fated to divest
their reign of all literary glory by bestowing the court honors
first upon Shadwell and then upon Nahum Tate, who had
some veins of merit, but no popular talent. Dryden praised
him in his day, and the “Book of Common Prayer” and our
church hymn books retain some choice lines that he wrote.
Queen Anne retained him ten years, but he was almost universally
regarded as stupid and juiceless in poetry, and at the age
of sixty-five, poor, homeless, unable to earn a living, she ejected
him from the laureateship, and he retired to the “Mint,” the
prison for the better class of poor debtors. Thus, in poverty
and humility ended the days of him who wrote our familiar
hymn,</p>

<div class="verse i1">And glory shone around.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Nicholas Rowe, with no popular fervor of verse, won high
favor in classic circles through an independent fortune and
rare social gift. Pope’s friendship welcomed him to the circle
of rare visits, while the <i>élite</i> of Queen Anne’s reign courted him
with royal art. Few men of real genius ever have been so
splendidly rewarded as he. Swift and Addison were only second
in their admiration to Pope, who wrote this tender
epitaph:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse i1">And near thy Shakspere place the honored bust;</div>

<p>Unknown as Rowe has proved to be to fame, he was blest
with the respect of his contemporaries, which could not be said
of his successor, Lawrence Eusden, then as well as now unknown
to fame, and yet he wore the laureate wreath twelve
years. Pope abused him in his “Dunciad,” Cooke in the
“Battle of the Poets” has this couplet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Eusden, a laurel’d bard by fortune raised,</div>
<div class="verse i1">By very few was read, by fewer praised.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The rhetorician, Oldmixon, says he never met a poet with
so much of the “ridiculum and fustian jumbled together, a
sort of nonsense which so perfectly confounds all ideas that
there is no distinct one left in the mind.” And yet the
Georges I. and II. placed the laurel on his brow.</p>

<p>George II., with characteristic misfortune, selected Colley
Cibber, whom Pope made famous—I had almost said infamous—in
these lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“In merry Old England it once was a rule,</div>
<div class="verse i1">The king had his poet, and also his fool,</div>
<div class="verse i1">But now we’re so frugal, I’d have you to know it,</div>
<div class="verse i1">That Cibber can serve both for fool and for poet.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>His father, Caius Gabriel Cibber, an artist, sculptured the
statues of two lunatics over the gates of Bedlam hospital. Although
the artistic work was creditable, Pope made the father’s
hand the medium of a savage attack on the son in the first
book of the “Dunciad,” which was written for the purpose
of making Eusden and Cibber, the laureates of George II.,
ridiculous. He thus introduces them as dunces:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Still Dunce the Second reigns like Dunce the First.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And thus he makes the father’s art serve his wicked purpose:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Close to those walls where Folly holds her throne,</div>
<div class="verse i1">When o’er the gates, by his famed father’s hand,</div>
<div class="verse i1">Great Cibber’s brazen, brainless brothers stand.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>His only literary work that has endured even in the knowledge
of scholars was an admirable autobiography which would
have honored his name had he the wit to let poetry alone.</p>

<p>Eusden and Cibber succeeded in one thing, they made the
position of laureate thoroughly undesirable, so that when upon
the latter’s death it was offered the author of the “Elegy Written
in a Country Churchyard,” Thomas Gray promptly declined it,
but William Whitehead accepted, serving during the excitement
preceding and attending the American Revolution. He
became at once the target for the shafts of satire aimed by his
fellow poets, Churchill endeavoring to persecute him as Pope
had his predecessors. But Whitehead had the rare grace to
bear all attacks in silence, living as comfortable and happy
a life as though there had been no satirical buzzing. He knew
he was not brilliant, and did not propose to make himself miserable
over it. Churchill might rasp him as caustically as he
chose, he would lose neither sleep nor peace of mind in consequence,
and this sublime indifference ultimately silenced all
critics, permitting him to enjoy thirty years of self-satisfied
service.</p>

<p>At his death Thomas Warton, the senior of two poetic brothers,
whom Hazlitt says was studious with ease and learned
without affectation, reclaimed the position from the contempt
in which it had been so long held. He achieved what should
satisfy the aspiration of any man successfully challenging the
public taste that had been the slave of the didactic school of
poetry under Pope, imparting a love for the poetry of nature
and the literary style of the Old English masters who lived out
of doors. It is hard to think that at his death the laureateship
sank lower than ever. It is humiliating to record that for a
quarter of a century Henry James Pye bore the honors, ushering
out the eighteenth and ushering in the nineteenth century,
a man of whom Byron expressed the universal disdain
when he wrote:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse i2">“What! What!</div>
<div class="verse">Pye come again? No more, no more of that.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Three names grace the laureate record of the past seventy
years, names of pioneers, each rapturously praised by admirers,
and as violently condemned by critics—Southey, Wordsworth
and Tennyson.</p>

<p>Taine, our racy French critic, places Southey in the first
rank of his class of poets, a clever man, an indefatigable
reader, inexhaustible writer, crammed with erudition, gifted in
imagination, gifted like Victor Hugo for the freshness of his
annotations and splendor of his picturesque curiosity. De
Quincy criticises him as being too intensely objective, with too
little exhibit of the mind as introverting upon its own thought
and feelings. He is distinguished at once for his unwearying
attacks upon the institutions of which the natural Englishman
is proud. This is readily accounted for from the fact that at
fourteen he was disgraced at Westminster school for writing
a sarcastic article on corporal punishment, for which the publisher
was prosecuted by the head-master, and that at Oxford
University, where he took a partial course, he was annoyed by
the exasperations of financial infelicities preventing high rank,
and ultimately forcing him away from scholastic privileges.</p>

<p>As a critic, historian and antiquarian Southey held high rank
among the scholars of the land, and yet he acquired his
scholarly taste and vast learning by out of school studies.</p>

<p>He was preëminently one of those curious creatures of circumstance
who are such because they have the tact to make
unpromising events serve them. He was too active a democrat
to hope for court favors, and too closely allied with the
Unitarians to venture within the church, and therefore happily
fell into association with Coleridge and his coterie. At the
time Coleridge was scheming as a high-toned communist to
send a colony to America to found a model, impracticable
republic on the banks of the Susquehanna, from which all
selfishness was to be banished, and Southey, at eighteen, attempted
to raise money for that object, failing in which he was
frequently a penniless youth.</p>

<p>To prevent the poverty stricken youth from marrying Mrs.
Coleridge’s sister, his uncle shipped him to Lisbon, but it was
too late, as the lad had already married her secretly on borrowed
money.</p>

<p>He was sixty years of age before he was financially
straight, and before he was eighty he died, leaving one of the
finest libraries in Europe and an estate of £12,000. His library
was the result of his habits of close study and devout
love of books. Of himself he wrote:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“My days among the dead are passed;</div>
<div class="verse i1">Around me I behold,</div>
<div class="verse i1">Where’er these casual eyes are cast,</div>
<div class="verse i1">The mighty minds of old;</div>
<div class="verse i1">My never-failing friends are they,</div>
<div class="verse i1">With whom I converse night and day.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A college chum befriended him in his youthful poverty and
settled upon him an annuity of £160, which prevented suffering
many times. He prided himself on early rising and was
at his desk soon after rising, whether he had special work on
hand or not. The morning after he had finished one of his
leading poems he wrote the first hundred lines of a more successful
one before breakfast. He worked almost literally every
hour of every day of every month of every year of his life,
until at seventy-six he broke down with softening of the brain.</p>

<p>William Wordsworth, a companion and admirer of Southey,
succeeded him as laureate. He was good naturedly ridiculed
by the literary world, but instead of being maddened thereby
as Byron was, instead of being heart-broken and sent to an
untimely grave as Keats was, he smiled serenely on his critics
and studiously sought to write as his critics did <i>not</i> wish him
to write, and thereby lived to enjoy a generous and widespread
appreciation.</p>

<p>While others went to Greece and Rome, to history and mythology
for heroes, he went into the streets, highways and byways,
huts and hovels, and chose the rude and crude, the loveless
and homeless for his poetic purpose. A more uniformly
prosperous, serene, moral man never graced English authorship,
and in his age he said with pride, “Whatever the world
may think of me or of my poetry is now of little consequence;
but one thing is a comfort in my old age, that none of my
works … contain a line which I should wish to blot out
because it panders to the baser passions of our nature.” Who
could ask to have more said of him than that he was always
correct in life, sweet in spirit, amiable in disposition, unwaveringly
conscious that he was doing his utmost to make the
world better?</p>

<p>Upon his death an effort was made to abolish the office of
laureate, but it failed and Alfred Tennyson was selected, and
has for thirty-five years poetized for the glory of England. It
is popular in our day to make light of Tennyson’s verse, but it
was not always thus, for our own classic Longfellow wrote:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“O sweet historian of heart!</div>
<div class="verse i1">To thee the laurel leaves belong,</div>
<div class="verse i1">To thee our love and our allegiance,</div>
<div class="verse i1">For thy allegiance to the poet’s art.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>
<p>The criticisms of no poet are so amusing. Ward (T. H.),
who is unrivaled in general judicious criticism, calling from
oblivion innumerable forgotten names, seems never to have so
much as heard of him, while Taine, our French critic, who unceremoniously
“skips” numerous poets of acknowledged
rank, gives to scarcely one English poet so extended, clear,
close, appreciative criticism as to Tennyson. Shaw in his “Literary
Compendium” does not deign to mention him, while Bayard
Taylor said “No English poet, with the possible exception
of Byron, has so ministered to the natural appetite for poetry.”
The average newspaper ridicules him as stupid, but one of our
keenest critics says, “He can gather up his strength like a serpent
in the gleaming coil of a line, or dart it out straight and free.”</p>

<p>When Tennyson appeared as a poet at the age of thirty-two
he evidenced a rare poetic taste, unlike that which had hitherto
catered to English readers. For a long time the poetry of
England had been prosy in the extreme, metaphysical, monotonous,
remorseful, dark and somber, and the appearance
of a poet light, graceful and sentimental, was an event calculated
to arouse the nation into joyous enthusiasm.</p>

<p>There was about his life, as in his stanzas, a poetic halo,
living as he did in the Isle of Wight, away from the rivalries
and annoyances of society. Queen Victoria appointed him
laureate, out of respect to the public demand that he be thus
honored.</p>

<p>It is three centuries since Spenser first wore the laurel. The
first century embraced five names, three of whom—Spenser,
Johnson and Dryden—were men of recognized superiority.
The second had no poet of note. From the reign of the Prince
of Orange to the independence of America there was no man
of talent who consented to sing the praises of William,
Mary, Anne or the Georges. The present century has
been honored by scholarly, virtuous men, devoid of marked
genius.</p>

<p>It is a delightful thing to be able to say that of the entire
sixteen, dull as some of them have been, they have been
almost unexceptionally men of recognized purity of character,
in ages when poets were renowned for their laxity of
morals.</p>

<h2 id="THE_NEW_YORK_CUSTOM_HOUSE">THE NEW YORK CUSTOM HOUSE.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">BY COLEMAN E. BISHOP.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>One day I said to the Factotum of the Collector of Customs
in New York, “I must do up the Custom House in a magazine
article of three thousand five hundred words; how much time
shall I need to give to the collection of data here?”</p>

<p>Factotum smiled compassionately on me and said: “About
three months!”</p>

<p>In this granite building on Wall Street, with its tall Ionic
columns, is transacted a business greater than all the industries
of the United States combined half a hundred years ago.
The merchandise that was inspected, weighed, counted, measured,
valued, catalogued here last year was valued at—count
the figures!—$857,430,637. The catalogue includes over three
thousand articles, many of which you never heard of and
would not even recognize the names thereof. Each of these
articles has its particular rate of duty, some having two or
three different ones. These have to be calculated specifically
on every package by quantity, or if the duty be <i>ad valorem</i>,
the value of the article has to be first determined and the
duty then calculated on the quantity of goods of that class.
These estimates and adjustments form the most intricate and
delicate business known to civilization. We sometimes think
<i>things</i> are plain and easy to administer upon, but the whole
range of metaphysics and abstract thought is not more perplexing
and doubtful than this mere business matter of levying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
and collecting the duties on goods passing the custom house.</p>

<p>I remember of hearing a debate in the Senate of the United
States upon a proposed amendment to the tariff laws. The
bill had been prepared and revised in a committee of Senators
most experienced and acute in such matters, and it had been
hammered over in long days of debate. Some one now asked
what would be the exact duty collectible under this bill on
the class of merchandise to which it related, and not a man
in the Senate could tell. Last winter, when it was proposed in
the House of Representatives to cut down the duties twenty
per cent. all around (“horizontal reduction”), it was demonstrated
by experts that the measure would work such confusion
that it could <i>not</i> be executed.</p>

<p>To illustrate the nicety and intricacies that have grown
around this business, take fabrics. The duty on silk goods and
that on cotton goods are different. In the case of mixed, silk and
cotton, it is, of course, different still. Then, whether the goods
be silk or cotton, or mixed, the duty is calculated by a double
standard—so much per square yard, and so much according
to its fineness and weight. They count the threads of warp
and woof in a square inch, and charge duty accordingly. If
there are two hundred threads to the inch the fabric must pay
a duty of, say, thirty-five per cent. <i>ad valorem</i>, if it cost over
twenty-five cents per yard; while on another piece counting
two hundred and one threads to the inch the duty shall be six
and a half cents per square yard and fifteen per cent. of its
cost. A single thread more or less may change the duty.
Then there is all the complication of fixing the value of goods.
I don’t suppose there is a farmer in the United States who can
ascertain by any amount of figuring what it costs him to raise
a pound of wool; yet the customs officers must fix the cost for
all wool that is imported. So of all other products on which <i>ad
valorem</i> duty is levied. Congress two years ago made a change
in the basis of valuation, by decreeing that the value of the package
in which goods are imported, the fees of brokers and other
middlemen in the country where the goods were bought, and
the cost of transporting them from points inland abroad to
the seaboard, should not be counted in the value of the goods.
All these items had before to be included in the appraisement.
The fine distinctions and the contested points in fixing duties
are innumerable. If any of them seem absurd and needlessly
exact, you must remember that every one of them has been
fought over between government and importers, between foreign
and American dealers, and between rival importers, and
has been established by experience as the best adjustment of
all conflicting interests. For the tariff system is the growth of
centuries. We inherited its leading features from England’s
protective system—what time that, instead of free trade, was
her better policy—and have gradually modified and expanded it
to suit the exigencies of our own national growth. Each item
in it is the record of more than fiscal economy. It measures
the government’s efforts, as well to defeat the devices of smugglers
and the designs of foreign producers as to raise its own
revenues. “As the laws of nations are the crystallizations of its
historical experiences, so the customs regulations of a people
are the residual crystallization of its commercial relations
with foreigners, its efforts at industrial development and self-preservation,
and its bitter acquaintance with greed, guile and
guilt.”<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p>The country’s acquaintance with greed, guile and guilt does
not stop at such manifestations of human nature in those who
seek to evade the payment of duties, either. It has to protect
itself at the same time against the dishonesty and incapacity
of its own servants. The customs system is therefore one of
checks and balances to secure (1) the impartial and rigorous
collection of <i>all</i> duties; (2) the prevention of mistakes in
accounts; (3) the prevention of frauds and peculations, both
inside and outside the custom houses. To secure all these the
system of book-keeping and business detail is grown wonderfully
complex and ingenious. The work is divided into three
departments, or bureaus, each under the head of its official,
all separate and distinct from one another, all under the jurisdiction
of the Collector of Customs, and yet each official having
his prerogatives and duties which the Collector can not interfere
with. Each department revises the work of the others
and tests accuracy and fidelity therein.</p>

<p>The Collector’s duties are to see that all the departments do
theirs.</p>

<p>The Surveyor of the Port has charge of all outside matters.
He is the eye of the Custom House. He is its right hand,
which is laid upon a vessel, its passengers and cargo as
soon as they enter the Narrows, and never taken off until all
dues and requirements of the government are paid and fulfilled.</p>

<p>The Appraiser is to inspect, value, and catalogue all merchandise,
and apportion the duties thereon.</p>

<p>The Naval Officer is to revise the work of all the others, and
correct errors and neglects, but he has nothing to do with the
machinery of collection.</p>

<p>To insure greater correctness there is a reviser of the revisers,
who about a year after the clearance of a cargo takes all the
papers connected with it, computes, compares and checks them
off, and ascertains what has become of all the goods invoiced.</p>

<p>One would suppose that after a ship and its invoices had run
the gauntlet of all these lynx-eyed officials, and the accounts
had been cast in half a dozen different ways, and the whole
affair probed, and pried open, and pried into, and taken to
pieces and put together again in different ways, errors and
frauds would be impossible. Importers evidently have not
such faith in the perfection and inevitableness of the system,
for appeals from the demands of the custom house are frequent,
and upward of five hundred suits in a year are brought
in court against the collector.</p>

<p>The best way to get a slight comprehension of the way this
labyrinthine business is done is to go through it once, in fancy.
Say you are a merchant traveling in Europe, and keeping an
eye on the main chance by buying a stock of silks, woolens,
and fancy goods; also dresses, gloves, and “knick-knacks,” for
gifts. When the former are ready to be shipped you have
three invoices made and presented to the United States Consul
of the port of shipment, for him to revise and approve as correct
descriptions of the goods. One of these invoices he keeps,
one he mails to the Collector of Customs at New York, and one
he gives the owner or consignee of the goods. If on opening
the consignment in New York the inspector find this invoice
does not correspond with the goods, it must be returned
to the consul for correction. Thus early in the transaction do
the safeguards begin.</p>

<p>Arrived in port, the vessel is boarded by inspectors who take
from the master the ship’s manifest and the other papers, and seal
up the hatchways, one remaining in charge of the ship while another
takes duplicates of the papers to the collector. The master
of the vessel also proceeds to the custom house and submits his
papers, which convey a complete history and description
of his vessel, its voyage, passengers, crew, cargo, stores, etc.,
etc. There are in some cases port dues and other charges against
the vessel for him to pay. His statement includes a schedule
of the number, nature, contents, consignees’ names and residences,
and markings and numbers of your packages of goods,
and of all others in the cargo. All this he vouches for under
oath. Thus, to begin with, the government has three accounts
of the cargo. The master is then given a permit to land his
cargo, still under surveillance of the inspector.</p>

<p>The cargo while being discharged on the wharf is checked
off by the manifest, so as to determine whether the cargo apparently
corresponds with the representations of the master and
his papers. The cargo being landed, the interests of yourself
and other consignees become active. You go to the custom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
house in person, or by a broker, present the bill of lading and
the invoices of your goods, certified by the consul; and you
state under oath that you have certain merchandise in the cargo
as set forth in the invoices, with the marks of the packages
and description of their contents. This is called an entry of
the goods. If approved, the papers are stamped, dated and
numbered, and the value of the goods and the rate of duty
are indorsed on the back of your invoice by the entry clerk.
He then issues to you a permit to take away such of the goods
as you choose, upon payment of the estimated duties thereon,
and after compliance with the further conditions described below.
If you choose to leave any of the goods for a season in
government warehouses, you need not pay the duties thereon,
but may give bonds for payment to be made whenever you do
take them. This is a bonded warehouse, and when you take
the goods it is called “taking them out of bond.” Often goods
intended for re-export are left in bond until sent out of the
country, and no duty is ever paid on such.</p>

<p>The correctness of these preliminary steps having been reviewed
and vouched for by the naval officer, certain portions
of the goods, about ten per cent., are sent to the appraiser’s
office, as samples from which the value of the whole consignment
may be appraised. Before the appraisal is made, however,
you must go to the cashier’s office and pay the <i>estimated</i>
duty on the goods wanted immediately, on their <i>apparent</i> value
as shown in the invoice; you must also give what is called a
“return bond” that you will not open the goods until ten days
after the appraiser has passed upon the samples, and that you
will return the goods to the custody of the collector if required
during that time; this enables the government to keep its hold
on the goods until the final adjustment of its claims. You now
get your permit indorsed by the deputy collector and the naval
officer, and take it to the inspector in charge of the vessel.</p>

<p>All your other papers are sent to the appraiser, with the sample
goods. His examiner identifies the one by the other and he
makes his estimates—a difficult and delicate task, sometimes.
The changes from the invoices, either in the quantity or value
of goods are noted, and the papers are returned to the collector’s
office, where the work of the appraiser as to classification
of goods and proper duties, to be paid is carefully revised.
If the appraiser’s work be disapproved it is returned to
him for correction. After he has amended it, it goes to the naval
office, where the whole work is again revised. Then it goes
finally to the Bureau of Liquidation, where if you have already
paid the right duty you can get a permit to take your goods;
if there is more to pay you pay it; if you have paid too much
the amount of the overcharge is returned to you. If you be
not satisfied with the valuation or any other feature of the adjustment
you can appeal, within a certain time, to the Secretary
of the Treasury, and if he sustain the collector you can
still further appeal to the United States Court. Or if the valuation
do not satisfy you, you can ask for a re-appraisement, or demand
to have the goods valued by a disinterested outsider expert
in such goods. Before him you can call expert witnesses
and make as good a case as possible.</p>

<p>If you find any of your goods have been damaged in the
voyage—say by bilge water or breakage—you can demand a
reduction of the valuation (and hence of the duty) in consequence.</p>

<p>You have now done with the custom house, but it has not done
with your papers. They are all gone over again in another way,
so as to verify them; and then all the data are tabulated in
such a way as to again prove the accuracy of the processes.
There is another review of them before the much-tested documents
are finally laid to rest. And as before noted, the whole
account of the cargo is re-examined a year later.</p>

<p>With the kid gloves and finery in your trunk you will have
less red-tape trouble. Inspectors from a revenue cutter have
boarded the ship down the Bay, and taken a sworn statement
from every passenger as to the number of pieces of baggage
he has, and whether or no he has any dutiable goods therein.
You may not know whether your goods are dutiable or not, and
what is of more importance to you, you may not know that
some things which are strictly dutiable in law and would have
to pay if put through the custom house in an invoice, can pass
free in your baggage. You shall see how and why this liberality
of the government is exercised.</p>

<p>Now you and your baggage are taken off the steamer and
transported on barges to the barge office at the Battery. Here the
scene is as animated, if not as picturesque, as at Castle Garden,
described in the October <span class="smcap">Chautauquan</span>. A large rotunda is
piled with long tiers of trunks, boxes and parcels, each ranged
under a placard bearing the letter which is the initial of the
owner’s name—so that it is easy for you to find yours, unless
you are as uncertain as to the orthography of your name as
Tony Weller was. A blue-clad, brass-badged inspector, holding
your sworn statement in his hand, demands the keys to
your trunks. The manner in which you comply will have
much to do with the rigor of his investigation, as will your
general appearance and make-up. These officials become as
good judges of character by externals as do railroad conductors.
One of the latter once said to me: “I can pick out all
the fresh passengers in a coach as soon as I open the door, by
the way they sit, look, and breathe. If they try to deceive,
their faces will betray them; they look too unconcerned and
innocent. If they feign sleep they overdo it; their attitudes
betray them.” So an inspector here says that people’s words,
movements, dress, all tell of them.</p>

<p>I can tell the incoming traveler an open secret. Uncle Sam is
extremely liberal in the matter of baggage inspection. You
would be surprised, sir or madam, at the things the inspector
don’t see, if you simply throw yourself on the government’s
generosity and act as if you expected to be liberally dealt
with. You have only to remember that your foot is on your
native heath, and you are an American citizen, one of the sovereigns.
An inspector said: “This property is personal effects,
and public sentiment is very sensitive as to domiciliary inspection
and invasion of private sanctity. The inspector is given
wide latitude of judgment; he must have it. By law, every
pair of kid gloves that has not been worn is dutiable, but we
began to allow a lady a few extra pairs, and finally the limit
was set at a dozen. Although that is liberal, we find that plenty of
ladies have more pairs in use; and if her appearance, dress,
and the other contents of the trunks justify it, we pass as many
as we fancy a lady in her station <i>might</i> possess. So of dresses,
laces, fans, fancy articles, et cetera. Even piece goods not cut
or sewed are under certain conditions ignored, if the owner
declares they are for her own necessary use. So of cigars.
Our rule is to pass a hundred duty free; but we don’t always
stop to count them, if the passenger looks like a man of means
and character. What would the seizure amount to if there were
ten or twenty, or even fifty over the arbitrary limit we have
fixed? The government does not do such ‘picayune business.’”</p>

<p>“Does not this leave the door open for smuggling?”</p>

<p>“Not much. A person can not get much through openly in
a trunk that can affect the revenues or injure honest importers.
The chief thing we need to prevent is passing goods intended
for selling. This sort of fraud is usually attempted by deception,
and we are pretty sure to detect it, either by the nervousness
or appearance of the person, by the looks of the baggage,
or by having been forewarned by detectives abroad, on shipboard
or here. We get a moiety share of the forfeiture and
fine, if we detect such attempts, and this is so large a sum that
our interests are mostly with the government.”</p>

<p>We will learn more about smuggling. False bottoms and
secret pockets in trunks are an old device for hiding things;
but the man who first secreted diamonds in his boot heel
originated something. Secreting about the person is the ruse
oftenest used, and, women’s costumes affording the best resources<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
for this purpose, women are the most frequent smugglers.</p>

<p>Some of them—reputable women, too—take quite superfluous
pains and make themselves look needlessly ridiculous by loading
their persons with apparel that no one would question if
in their trunks, and no one does on their persons, except to
smile at the self-exposure. On a hot July day I saw elegant
appearing ladies in the barge office, sweating under enormous
fur cloaks that made them look like Arctic explorers. This
foible is neatly satirized in “Nothing to Wear,” in which is
described the enormously stout appearance of <i>Miss Flora McFlimsy</i>
upon landing.</p>

<p>One day the inspector witnessed a woman waddling down
the gang plank with the body of a two hundred pounder and
the face and head of a skinny, ninety-five pounder. Of course
she was invited to the examination room by the female inspector,
where the peripatetic ladies’ furnishing store was opened up
and duty demanded on the whole outfit. The same things in
a trunk would probably have gone through, most of them.
Here the open and honest course were the wisest.</p>

<p>Laces, silks, and linens are wound around the body and
limbs, or made up into extra and superfluous skirts. Coiffeurs
are made to serve as bustles; extra gold watches and jewelry
are hung to the inside of skirts, and a dozen other devices are
the suggestion of lovely and ingenious woman.</p>

<p>Here, as well as on the Canada frontier, women are found
most apt at amateur smuggling. The reasons for this are
numerous. Women are by education and domestic necessity
close buyers and can not usually forego a bargain. The lines
of duty, moral or fiscal, are not closely drawn or clearly defined
here. Smuggling is a statutory offense, not a moral
crime, and from time immemorial injustice and favoritism have
been alleged against the whole tariff on imports. You shall
hear plenty of good moral men to-day denouncing all tariff as
robbery. Besides, what deference for or loyalty to government
demands should we expect of women when they are denied all
share in government or law-making? Over against these customs
peccadilloes we may set the unanimous verdict of business
men that in positions of financial trust and responsibility, and
as debtors, women are almost universally honest.</p>

<p>The belief is quite common that smuggling through luggage
is much practiced by feeing the inspectors. Of course, the inspectors
deny this. They point to the superior inducements to
fidelity on their part in the share they secure of seizures, forfeitures,
and penalties; to the risk they run of detection in accepting
bribes, the inspection being done openly with many interested
spectators and paid spies about, and to the serious consequences
of detection. Moreover, since the courts in the celebrated
Astor suit decided that anything may pass which the
person would swear is for personal or family use, the <i>necessity</i>
for bribery is largely done away. Mr. Astor recovered
from government duties upon $40,000 worth of luggage that
had been seized.</p>

<p>This story is told: Two years ago a woman landed with as
many trunks as a banyan tree; the inspector had been notified
that she was a fashionable milliner in New York. She said to
the inspector, “I am in great hurry, and if you will put my baggage
right through and come up to my store this evening I will
give you a five pound note.” The collector scented more than
twenty-five dollars for himself in forfeitures, and began the
examination. A dozen pairs of new kid gloves, of four different
sizes, were the first thing uncovered. The lady protested that
they were all for herself, and that she was entitled to a dozen,
and they were passed. But when more gloves of different
sizes were found, until there were half a gross, she began to
raise her bid. Then fifty pairs of new shoes of many different
sizes were turned out, and then silks, flowers, ribbons, fans,
and finery <i>à la</i> McFlimsy. She at last offered three hundred
dollars to have the trunks passed, but as there was about
twelve hundred dollars worth of goods on which was a duty to
collect of, say, five hundred dollars, all of which (seventeen
hundred dollars) was forfeit, it was no use. The business had
gone to a point where the owner could not afford to bid against
the government for the purchase of the inspector’s honor.
The goods were sent to the seizure room, and the woman was
sued for the penalty, as it exceeded the value of the property.
After two years of obstacles and delay the case was compromised
and settled. The inspector told me that his share of the
damages would be much more than the three hundred dollars
she offered. Honesty is the best policy, virtue is its own reward,
and everybody is honest when it pays best, you see. If
the woman had not offered the bribe, and thus put it out of the
power of the official to show her any leniency, she would have
been allowed to take the goods away on payment of simple
duty. She at least learned that there is a time and way for all
things, including bribery.</p>

<h2 id="THE_CHRISTIAN_REVOLT_OF_THE_JEWS_IN_SOUTHERN_RUSSIA">THE CHRISTIAN REVOLT OF THE JEWS IN SOUTHERN RUSSIA.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">BY BISHOP JOHN F. HURST, D.D., LL.D.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>There is a little country in the south-eastern corner of Europe,
bordering on the Black Sea, which goes by the name of
Bessarabia. It drops into the angle formed by the Black Sea
and one of the three mouths of the Danube. Before the
Crimean war it was a part of Russia, but in consequence of
Russia’s defeat in that war she was compelled, in the treaty,
to give it up to Turkey, and until six years ago it remained a
part of the Turkish Empire. But in the late war between Russia
and Turkey it was Russia’s time to win, and so she took
back Bessarabia, and it again became a part of her dominions.
It has always been the scene of a busy and peculiar life. The
very river itself seems to have imparted much of its current to the
people, and they have been thinking, in their own humble
way, of the best means to promote their own interests.</p>

<p>The most recent movement in this small section of Russia is
the religious awakening of the Jews who settled in Bessarabia
many years ago, being driven there by the pressure of persecution,
and leading a quiet life, saying nothing as the lash came
down upon them. From one step to another this religious
reformation has proceeded, all the while approaching Christianity,
until now it is a strong and still growing work, and in
all essential respects, save only organic unity, is allied with the
Christian church. It has already attracted the attention of
inquiring minds in western Europe, and threatens to extend
into the hitherto firm body of Judaism, and awaken intense
Christian aspirations and sympathies in the Jewish mind
throughout the world. Delitzsch, of Leipzig University, has
given some account of the general features of the revolution in
his <i>Documente der National-jüdischen Christgläubigen Bewegung
in Südrussland</i>, but the most that has been written has
thus far been in fugitive form, in the Slavic periodicals of the
Danubian principalities. The whole affair has taken place in
such an obscure country, and so far removed from the busy
centers of European thought and life, that it has not had time
to get into the permanent field of literature. Its leaders have
been so little accustomed to rely on the press, or to take it into
view as a means of propagating their opinions, that in this new
phase of their work they have depended simply on the justice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
their cause and the firm principles which they believe underlie
it. From various sources, and especially from the Rev. Dr.
Kleinheim, of Bucharest, who has been a resident of this far-off
city about twenty years, and is probably better acquainted
with the internal working of Judaism in eastern and southern
Europe than any other man, I have gathered the most of the
data which I herewith present to your readers. This gentleman
has spent his life in trying to christianize the Jews of
Moldavia and Wallachia, and his labors have been remarkably
successful. He has been kind enough to answer all my
inquiries, and to open to me some of the interior views of this
important and unique movement which could not have been
secured at a distance.</p>

<p>The prime mover in this revolt against pure Judaism, and in
favor of Christian adaptations, is a layman, Joseph Rabinowitz.
He is a lawyer by profession, and for learning, and as a pure
and elevated character, he has been long held in the highest
repute by his companions in faith throughout Bessarabia.
From his very development into manhood he seems to have
been interested in the improvement of their condition, and to
have conceived the idea that there must be some new and
easy solution of their solitude and sorrow. In 1880 he presented
a plan, which was more theoretical and fanciful than
practical, by which the Jewish priesthood might be thoroughly
reorganized, and thereby the whole Jewish system undergo a
most salutary rehabilitation. There was, however, no intimation
here that any form of Christianity should be superadded
to Judaism. But he had his thoughts, and applied himself
with redoubled energy to helping his brethren to something
better than they had so far possessed, both in faith and material
comfort. The Jews have seldom shown any sympathy
with agriculture. They are a folk of trade, the world’s shopmen
and money changers. But Rabinowitz endeavored to
introduce agriculture among the Bessarabian Jews, and to
locate them in pleasant and open homes. By and by, in 1882,
the violent persecution of the Jews of the whole of southern
Russia broke out, and neither life nor property seemed to rest
on any approach to a secure base.</p>

<p>Rabinowitz now turned his attention to the Holy Land. He
felt that Russia was no place for the Jews to live in, that they
should go to a country where their fathers had once been great
and strong, that now Palestine had only a sparse population,
that the Jews would not be disturbed there in any way, and
that they should wander hither, become tillers of the soil, and
develop once more into a great people. He went there himself,
made a careful study of the country, and especially of its
history, and came to the startling conclusion that the land itself,
from positive internal evidence, gives the fullest and
clearest proof possible, to-day, that such a character as Jesus
Christ did live in it, that he, and none other, is the promised
Messiah, that all further expectation of a Messiah on the part
of the Jews is idle, and that the only proper course for them to
adopt is to accept him as their Savior and Redeemer. This is
concession which lies at the root of all Judaism; once granted,
there is positively nothing essential left.</p>

<p>Rabinowitz had gone to Palestine for the sole purpose of
opening the country for a new immigration, not only of Jews
from Bessarabia, but from every land. He saw in the occupation
of the country, by his fellow-believers, a magnificent future
for them. But through some strange providence, which no
one seems yet to understand, he saw a larger future—the Jews
of all lands coming to the cross of Christ. He went back to
Bessarabia, and soon astounded his companions in doctrine
by his bold and impassioned declarations of the divine character
of Jesus. With the genius of the real leader, he adopted
a watchword, which has now become broadly known as the
rallying cry of all Jews who share his doctrine: “The key of
the Holy Land lies in the hand of our brother Jesus.”</p>

<p>There is no want of clearness in the creed of this new and
striking departure in Judaism. It is an adoption of the fundamental
doctrines of Christianity; at the same time, however,
those who entertain these doctrines do not propose to
withdraw from Judaism completely, but to retain some of the
minor features of the old system, and to refrain from joining
any Christian denomination. They call themselves “The
National Jewish Society of the New Testament.” In their articles
of faith, as communicated by Pastor Faltin, of Kischinev,
to Dr. Delitzsch, they hold the following general views:
There is one living and true God, creator of all things. He
made a covenant with Israel, his people, that he would raise
from their midst a prophet, who should have the spirit of the
Lord, and himself be the Lord, who would plant righteousness
throughout the earth. This prophet is the promised Messiah,
who taught the people the truth, and bore their sins, and died
for the whole world. He was born about seventy years before
the destruction of the second temple, and died at the hands of
his enemies. He will rule the house of David, and exalt the
horn of his people for ever more. The Jews of his time were
stricken with blindness. The light was before them, but because
of their hardness of heart they were punished with helplessness.
Hence they killed their Lord. It is now time to
open their eyes, and see him whom their fathers slew. He
alone is Redeemer. He alone can build up the Jewish people.
From all lands they should hasten to Palestine, and accept
Christ immediately, and expect nothing less than that he will
restore Jerusalem to its former glory, and build there once
more the throne of David.</p>

<p>Such is the mere thread of doctrine which pervades this new
system, but there is interwoven with it a certain general paraphrase
of teaching, which it is also necessary to understand.
This is furnished Dr. Delitzsch by Wilhelm Faber (of Kirsanoff),
who took notes one afternoon when Rabinowitz himself
gave a survey of his creed. “We Jews,” says the leader,
“who have come into the full vision of Jesus Christ, and now
feel the power of his spirit, have not come to the great light
through any general indoctrination from without. No, we
have looked deeply into the Old and New Testaments, and
have found that God takes no pleasure in the death of the sinner,
and that he loves his people Israel, and is willing to save
them. Our reflection has become stirred by the miracles of
Jesus. We see in them the evidences of his divinity and the
proofs of his love toward us. We have come to look to our
brother Jesus as the Messiah, and to find in him our only hope
of salvation.”</p>

<p>While Rabinowitz has organized his companions in this new
doctrine into a separate religious body, which does not alienate
itself fully from Judaism, it differs from Christianity widely
enough to prevent perfect affiliation with it. It stands upon
the border-line, being neither positively Jewish nor altogether
Christian. Rabinowitz finds fault with Christians for being
divided into many confessions, and congratulates his fellow-believers
from among the Jews on the ease with which they
can build themselves into a new organization without the embarrassment
of subdivisions. In answer to the question as to
whether circumcision should be enforced in this new religious
society, Rabinowitz says: “It is not sinful to abstain from
circumcision, but he who does so abstain cuts himself off from all
relation to his people.” He, therefore, makes this rite a part
of the creed of his church, but not a necessity. He regards
the sentences of the Old and New Testaments as of equal
validity, and rejects the Talmud and the writings of the rabbinists
as not of authoritative force, but as valuable monuments
of an early time. He adopts the communion service of the
Lutheran church, and makes baptism an essential part of his
system.</p>

<p>Rabinowitz propounded his doctrines to his fellow Jews only
two years ago, and in this brief time over two hundred families
have formally united with him. Of course the regular Jews do
not endorse such a departure. They regard it as a miserable
apostasy, and proclaim loudly against it. On the other hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
the Christian church can not hail it with unmixed pleasure,
inasmuch as the “National Jews” still adhere to some parts of
the Jewish system, and must make some important concessions
before they can be regarded as a thorough religious body.</p>

<p>In what light, therefore, must these Jews, who have accepted
Christ and his full atonement, be held? Can we see in their
doctrines a sign of real hope for the entire Jewish world? We
think that only one answer can be given, the one which
Delitzsch and other close students of the Hebrew mind, both
past and present, have been compelled to give—namely, that
we see here an evidence of the breaking up of the old Jewish
solidity. Mendelssohn and others have proven that the Jews
are subdivided among themselves, that there are numerous
tendencies which pervade the entire body, and that these are
constantly growing stronger. This, however, is the first instance
where an important part of the Jewish church has
openly adopted the atonement of Christ, and proposes to rise
or fall by that alone. May it not be the great outcome of the
Jewish mystery, that large sections will formally adopt Christianity;
that not as individuals but as vast territorial sections
they will renounce their old faith and take their place among
Christian bodies; and that in due time they will drop the
Jewish name altogether, and be thoroughly identified with the
great Christian church in all its activities and grand purposes?</p>

<p>The middle ground of the National Jews of to-day, as occupied
and preached by Rabinowitz, is simply an impossibility
for the future. It is neither one thing nor another. Its exact
parallel, in our day, can be found in the impossible church of
Father Hyacinth. His work is neither all Protestant nor all
Roman Catholic. To succeed it must become Protestant, and
formally reject all attachments to the old Romanism. There
must be no looking back when once the “hand is put to the
plow.” Had Martin Luther stood all his life upon the door-sill
of Roman Catholicism, looking out and yet not going out,
his work would have been a total failure, and have shown a
lack of that final courage which makes a successful revolution.
We must, however, bear in mind the fact that he was preceded
by men who had taken positive ground, but not the last step.
To their moderate work he owed much. He saw their failure,
and the cause of it, and hence he broke the whole yoke and
became a free man. In the same useful line must we rank the
doctrines and work of Rabinowitz. He may not take all the
advanced course which we would like, and which history reveals
as only the true Reformer, but he is the sure forerunner
of one or more who will do this work. It is one of the ways in
which God distributes his honors, that his great movements are
not conducted by one alone. There is always the Baptist, and
sometimes many, who must preach in the wilderness, before
the full gospel of the mountain side and sea shore can be heard
from the lips of the world’s Teacher. In this light, as the
prophecy of a new religious awakening among the Jews, who
have for all ages rejected all approaches from Christianity,
must we regard the doctrines and work of Rabinowitz and his
friends. His cause is rapidly growing, and must continue to
grow. While it is not a finality, it is in the right direction, and
hence a blessing which all Christian people must hail with
pleasure.</p>

<h2 id="THE_INNER_CHAUTAUQUA">THE INNER CHAUTAUQUA.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">BY CHANCELLOR J. H. VINCENT, D.D.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>Chautauqua is a place and an idea. The idea was before the
place; although it must be confessed that the embodiment of the
thought in a physical frame-work of soil and forest had a most
wholesome effect on the idea itself, giving it a chance to draw
strength from its external conditions; to “ultimate” its conceptions
in action; to experiment with raw material; to command
the attention and elicit the commendation on which
good things thrive, and to adapt its aim and energy to the variety
of people and conditions with which it proposed to deal.</p>

<p>The place is beautiful, and grows more beautiful with the
passing years. Nature has not suspended her beneficent ministries
since Art pitched her pavilion by the side of these
waters. Trees still put forth branches and clothe them with
foliage. The old trees stand like venerable giants, with as
much of hope as of memory in their hearts, and in their annual
robe of verdure forget that for so many years they have
watched the coming and the going of the seasons. Young
trees that have grown a dozen years older since the first Chautauqua
song broke the silence are now stately and beautiful,
ready to be witnesses for a hundred years, of the strange
things to be done here, and of which we who are looking about
for graves only dream of now. The lake—who shall tell of its
moods, its smiles and frowns, its loud murmurings of unrest
when the fierce winds come down in power upon it; its low
sobbings after the storm, trying to forgive and forget; its sweet
answers to the toying breeze; its splendor when the moon
flings a robe of silver over it; and when the sun, making it a
mirror, rejoices in it (as Christ in the true saints) because it
faithfully reflects his own glorious image?</p>

<p>Art has not altogether been useless, although more than
once unwise. Penuriousness has sometimes spoiled lines and
angles, and mixed bad colors. Stupidity has blundered into
sad combinations and contrasts; but on the whole Art has
clasped hands with Nature, and made the place Chautauqua a
lovely and fitting tabernacle for the Chautauqua Idea.</p>

<p>There is a Chautauqua within Chautauqua. To see this
other Chautauqua, one must have eyes—eyes that look into
the innermost things. He must see beyond groves and crowds,
beyond lake and sky, beyond buildings and programs. He
must be able to see necessities, intellectual and spiritual, in the
individual and in society, tendencies of thought, forces of conviction,
pressures of desire and ambition, the conflict of new and old
civilizations in the personal life, as circumstances bring a man
face to face with the new, while yet from habit and feeling he
is held half-slave by the old.</p>

<p>He who sees Chautauqua must understand the relations (not
generally understood) between gracious culture and the rough,
unæsthetic services which people must render each other and
their own lives in this world, services of feeding and clothing
and cleaning and housing—low, gross and humiliating, as
judged from an artist’s studio or a “poet’s frenzied mood.”
He must find out that high and low, noble and ignoble are relative
terms; that a kitchen may for a time cage an angel whose
hands dabble in dough, and whose tired feet in coarse shoes
tread rough floors. She may serve her inferiors and treasure
the pittance they give her to buy books for her brain life, at
least that portion of the pittance she does not need to feed
unfortunate people who depend upon her. When crowns are
given out, a marvelous readjustment of relations will take
place, and certain little neighborhoods will be shaken with surprise.</p>

<p>Chautauquans with eyes see the distinctions in advance, and
recognize the crowns that hover in mid-air over the saints, and
they pay honors to “Alfreds in neat herd’s huts” before the
throne is ready.</p>

<p>Chautauquans who have eyes to see have discovered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
strong and delicate cords of religious life which run through
and unite all the diverse elements of life into a sacred harmony—a
sacrament exceeding holy.</p>

<p>Chautauquans see God in everything and find in everything
ways of coming near to him. They believe in nature and in
science—true science—and abide by her final decisions, and
take delight in her processes. But they believe also in a
<span class="smcap">Father</span> whose thought makes scientific thought possible, and
of whose creative and controlling thought science is but an interpretation.</p>

<p>Chautauquans believe in the God of the Book—the <span class="smcap">Book</span> of
Books. They do not trouble themselves about the <i>modus</i>, the
<i>quantum</i> and the <i>qualitas</i> of inspiration. They simply take the
book in its entirety, as the book given to be studied, trusted,
loved, and obeyed, as individual conscience and judgment respond
to its contents after calm, devout and diligent study
thereof; and not to be quarreled over or quibbled about, or
forced to sustain preconceived or preaccepted notions by a
string of separated texts on the cord of a curious fancy, or an
antiquated dogma. They put BOOK and soul together, and
trust both thoroughly for fair treatment.</p>

<p>Chautauquans “study the Word and the Works of God.”
And so firm is their faith in the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span> who wrought the works
and inspired the Word, and in the spirit of man for whom the
Word was inspired, that they feel it not strange that God the
Father should “dwell in the midst of them,” folding his own
children to his heart and breathing of his own spirit into their
spirits, enlightening, regenerating, comforting, witnessing.
And as trust grows and desire increases this access becomes
less and less interrupted, and they hope one of these days in
all wisdom, reason and sense to trust in God continually, and
every day to feel his presence and rejoice in his grace.</p>

<p>Chautauquans, however, discriminate between this divine
possession which captures and sways intellect and will week
days and Sundays, in business and in church life steadily and
effectively, and the mere spasms of resolution under pressure of
occasion; the selfish efforts over fancied personal security; the
studied outward conformity to religious duties according to the
ebb and flow of religious emotion. They believe so firmly in the
kingdom and patience of our Lord that obedience is worth more
than comfort and faith, a firmer foundation than sight or feeling.</p>

<p>To Chautauquans, therefore, all things hold a measure of
God’s infinite wisdom. All things are precious, for in all things
one may find traces of his grace. All things are sublime, for
all things are connected with a glorious unity, which fills
heaven and earth, eternity past and eternity to come. Flowers,
fossils, microscopic dust, foul soil, things that crawl and
things that soar, ooze from the sea-depths, lofty heights that
salute the stars—all are divine in origin and nature. A boot-black
may be a king—boot-black and king—both at once.
Human eyes see only the black hands, patched knees and
crouching form that bespeak servility. There are eyes that
can see deeper and further. Seeing so much they extend a
hand of greeting. Then kings and saints converse.</p>

<p>Chautauquans believe in Wealth when honesty wins it, prudence
protects it, and benevolence uses it. They believe in
Position when worth secures it, work honors it, and humility
attends it. They believe in Culture, when teachableness goes
before it, and all the faculties in true harmony receive it and
religion inspires and controls it. They believe in Labor, when
true social relations distribute it, when no one family of faculties
is abused by it, and when true, reverent and philanthropic
motives direct it.</p>

<p>Chautauquans are believers in a common brotherhood—but
are not “communists.” They are open to truth, and hold an
inheritance in all truth, and are subject only to the truth. But
they are not boastful free thinkers in</p>

<p class="unindent">dogmatizing and denouncing. They believe in truth, God,
and humanity. They seek the first, rejoice in the second, and
serve the third.</p>

<p>These are some of the ideas which belong to the Chautauqua
movement—the thoughts within the things—the theories of
which phenomenal Chautauqua is a visible expression.</p>

<p>How shall we arrange a program? It is a constantly recurring
query for instruction committees. A skillfully planned program
insures an interested society, but it is no easy undertaking
for even a very wise committee to plan a series of exercises
which shall be of just the right length, of pleasing variety, and
on topics in which every one will be interested. Only a careful
study of the reading of the month, a knowledge of the taste
and ability of the circle, and considerable practice will guarantee
a really good program. Many hints may be gathered,
we believe, each month from the programs presented in <span class="smcap">The
Chautauquan</span>. At least, many circles report that they find
them helpful. The <span class="smcap">Quincy, Ill.</span>, circle writes: “Those programs
are a very great help to us.” At <span class="smcap">Kittery, Maine</span>,
where a circle of ten active members has been in operation for
three years, they have adopted <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span> programs,
and express the belief that with them they will do better work
than ever before. This modest little circle has never made itself
known before, but in a quiet way has done much good with the
“Popular Education” circular. At least one circle in another
state owes its existence to its efforts. One of their amusements
is the Chautauqua games, and they say that the use of
these games has led to much close reading of the books and
articles. The regular programs are used, too, at <span class="smcap">Shenandoah,
Iowa</span>, where a circle of twenty-five members, representing the
classes of ’86, ’87, and ’88, are meeting weekly. The plan has
proven very successful with them, they write. Bryant’s Day was
celebrated by special exercises. This circle has found, as we believe
all readers will, that bringing all the Greek studies into
one year is a great help, instead of a drawback. The more
one knows on any subject, the greater his interest. The Greek
course of this year enables us to learn a great deal on that subject.</p>

<p>At <span class="smcap">Putnam, Conn.</span>, <span class="smcap">West Middlesex, Pa.</span>, and <span class="smcap">Dartford,
Wis.</span>, circles report the adoption of these same programs. The
organization at Putnam, numbering eighteen members, is of recent
date, although there have been several young people
there pursuing the prescribed course for the past five years.
An interesting variation to their program is a paper called the
<i>Olla Podrida</i>. It is made up of original contributions from
the members, and is issued monthly, a different editor being
appointed each time. The Middlesex circle is in its second
year. It has had already an addition of four ’88s. Dartford circle
of six members is a new addition to our ranks, and a very
welcome one. We feel sure that the hope they express of gaining
great benefit from the Required Readings will not be disappointed.</p>

<p>While many circles find the prescribed exercises satisfactory,
we are glad to know that others vary performances to suit the
talents and interests of their members. This is found necessary
in the <span class="smcap">Bowling Green, Ohio</span>, circle, we learn from a recent
letter. They use the programs simply as a model, and
work according to their talent. All the features of a first-class
circle are found in this year-old circle at Bowling Green.
They boast a goodly membership, an efficient president, a
thorough organization, a constitution which all cordially support,
and much social life. The first annual reception of our
Bowling Green friends was given last summer. In September
they wisely held their first meeting, that their plans might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
laid to begin work the first week of October—a point which
many of us would do well to bear in mind until next fall. Bryant’s
Day was observed, and very flatteringly noticed in their
local paper. Among the virtues which we infer belong to this
circle we must include the missionary spirit. They have in
mind the conversion of their whole county to the C. L. S. C.</p>

<p>The same plan in regard to programs is followed at <span class="smcap">Ludington,
Mich.</span>, where there is a new circle of twenty-seven members,
called “Père Marquette”—a magnificent beginning.
Our correspondent writes: “We enjoy our reading and our
weekly meetings very much indeed; the only regret I have is
that I have let so much time slip by before taking the course.”</p>

<p>Some of the programs sent us contain novelties which when
introduced into a purely literary program are very agreeable
diversions. One which is capable of being made very entertaining
we find in a program from a newly organized circle of
thirty members—nearly all ’88s—at <span class="smcap">Norwich, Conn.</span> It is
character personation (“Who am I?”). The well known game,
“Characters,” is another number on one of their programs.
The response to roll-call by quotations on Bryant’s Day was
improved by stating after the quotation an interesting fact from
the life of the poet. The Norwich members are certainly to
be congratulated on the variety in their exercises.</p>

<p>Another <span class="smcap">Connecticut</span> circle which has a particularly good
plan for its evenings is the “Quintette” local circle, of <span class="smcap">Sharon</span>.
They have but recently organized, and report their plan
for work as experimental; successful, too, we prophesy it will
be. The secretary informs us: “We intend to learn the questions
and answers in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>, and recite at our
regular meetings, held every two weeks. For the present we
in turn are to read aloud selected articles from <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>
and ‘Cyrus and Alexander;’ after each reading discussing
in general conversation, what has been read, commenting
on pronunciation, looking up references concerning people and
places mentioned, and trying to inform ourselves thoroughly
about what has been read.” That plan of preparing programs a
month in advance, and giving to each member a printed copy
has been adopted by the “Longfellow” circle, of <span class="smcap">North Cambridge,
Mass.</span> This circle has begun its second year with extraordinary
vigor, the membership being largely increased.</p>

<p>One objection that may be urged against the majority of the
programs is that they are too long. It is difficult to make them
short. There is so much we want to talk about; so many
charming selections to read, such a wealth of subjects for essays,
it is not strange that sometimes we tire out ourselves and
our guests by overdoing matters. To avoid this try the plan of
the <span class="smcap">Sacramento, Cal.</span>, circle, which introduces midway in
the evening a “recess of fifteen minutes.” It will prove many
a time a saving clause. Another feature of their plan of work
may furnish some one an idea; it is that a committee should
prepare a set of questions, distribute them one week, and that at
the following meeting, the answers, as original and concise as
possible, should be read. The circle which has given us these
two ideas enrolls itself among the strong and enthusiastic circles.
Their year opened most promisingly, six new names being
added to their roll. “We all,” they write, “seem to have
caught the true Chautauqua inspiration, and it has fired our
hearts and elevated the character of our work.” To the hints
on programs which the letters of the month have given us we
must add two programs, which seem to us particularly good;
the first one comes from the circle at <span class="smcap">Baltimore, Md.</span>, now
in its sixth year, and is of the Bryant memorial service:</p>

<p>The many newly organized circles which are coming in day
after day testify that a great amount of work has been done by
somebody in the interests of the C. L. S. C. It is true, much has
been done. Much more is being done; of how much nothing
that we have received is more suggestive than the following
letter from a prominent member of the class of ’87, Mr. K. A.
Burnell, and it must be remembered that there are many more
workers as zealous as is Mr. Burnell:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Walla-Walla, Washington Territory</span>, November 10, ’84.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Chautauquan</span>:—As a member of ’87, and deeply interested
in every one of the 18,000 whose names appear on the two big books at
Plainfield, as well as every one reading in any one of the classes of all
of the great Chautauqua household, I venture an account of an evangelistic
tour over the Northern Pacific Railroad.</p>

<p>Miss Kimball most kindly mailed me the names of the two to three score
of readers in Dakota, Montana, Idaho, and Washington Territories, and I
wrote eighteen letters to as many points, indicating that as one deeply
interested in the C. L. S. C., I was to be over the Northern Pacific
Railroad on an evangelistic tour, and should be happy to meet circles or
individual readers, and render any service possible, and I felt sure if
I imparted nothing I should not fail to be a recipient. I heard from
most of the messages, and with uniform and marked interest in the fact
of meeting one late from Chautauqua, and especially with a member of
the Pansy class of ’87.</p>

<p>At Fargo, Casselton, Cooperstown and Mandan, Dakota, I found individual
readers, and did what I could to induce others to take up the
course. My habit was at the close of each service to make a few minutes’
statement concerning the C. L. S. C. readings, their rapid growth,
and their very great advantage and exceeding helpfulness. I received
from Plainfield a generous package of the green books, admission
sheets, and circulars, and at each place these documents were placed in
the hands of the people at the close of the public service, and were received
gladly.</p>

<p>At Gladstone, Dakota, the very patient and self-forgetting Scotch-Irish
minister brought from his five miles distant ranch, his three sons
and two daughters, with whom after the service I drove home, passing
the night and most of the next day, the good minister then driving me
to my next appointment (Dickinson), which also was one of his preaching
places.</p>

<p>This family, as a whole, became so interested in the C. L. S. C. readings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
(it was not new to them) as to fully decide to take the course, and
at once enter upon it. These bright, thoughtful and inquiring young
people will be benefited beyond estimate by their thought, research and
study, and by their intimate relations to the great numbers who are pursuing
the same stimulating studies. The adaptation of our grand everybodies’
college to meet a great want has striking application in this exemplary
minister’s home.</p>

<p>At Helena, Montana’s capital, rich and wicked, there is a single
reader, but I failed to find her after repeated public intimations. At
Rathdrum, Idaho, the only reader (a school teacher) had gone away to
the mines. No readers from Oregon were announced from Plainfield,
but I was glad indeed to find a circle in good beginning in connection with
and at the rooms of the Young Men’s Christian Association of Portland.</p>

<p>The Portland Y. M. C. A. is a vigorous and hard-working company, and
in its adoption of the C. L. S. C. readings is doubtless a prophecy
as to the future. At Seattle and Tacoma, Washington Territory, under
the shadow of grand, old, snow-capped Mount Tacoma, the only glacier
mountain in this county, I found a single reader, and one family reading.
Steps were taken for forming a circle at an early day. The delights
of an evangelistic campaign of forty-five days on the Northern Pacific
Railroad have been deepened because of our Chautauqua classmates.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">K. A. Burnell.</span></p>

</div>

<p>This individual effort has been supplemented by a great deal
of newspaper work. Through the past year very many valuable
articles on the C. L. S. C. have appeared from time to
time. The <i>Daily Arkansas Gazette</i>, of <span class="smcap">Little Rock</span>,
recently contained such an article from the pen of Mrs.
Myra Vaughan. It gave all the details of our work, correctly
and interestingly—an article that everybody would read, and
having read would ponder. These efforts have told. The
number of new circles claiming our recognition this month is
the best proof of their success. Listen while we run through
the list: A club called the “Clio” club has been formed at <span class="smcap">Newport,
Vermont</span>. There are sixteen members, and the meetings
are held weekly. The club has a corresponding secretary, and
would be glad to open communication with other circles.——At
<span class="smcap">Woodstock, Vt.</span>, seven ladies organized, on September 19,
the “Mayflower” circle. They began on Garfield’s Day, with
a celebration—an admirable plan—and on November 10th observed
Bryant’s memorial day. A bit of personal effort comes
with our report, which is worth saving. The lady to whom the
circle largely owes its life is the mother of five children, two of
whom she teaches at home, while she does all the work for a
family of eight. Still she finds time for the C. L. S. C. Another
demonstration of our old proverb about “a will” and “a way.”——A
letter from <span class="smcap">Newtonville, Mass.</span>, says: “We have
started this year a local circle, and hasten to inform you of the
fact which gives us so much pleasure; although our number is
at present small, being but thirteen, still we are in earnest, and
interested in our work, and propose to go through. Our number
is made up of very busy people—housekeepers, teachers,
young men of business, etc. We attended—that is, most of
us—the Framingham Assembly, and there became filled with
enthusiasm which terminated in the foundation of our circle.”——Another
Massachusetts circle is heard from at <span class="smcap">Ipswich</span>,
whence the secretary writes: “This fall a C. L. S. C. was formed
in our town in time to begin work October 1. We organized
with about fifteen members; since then our circle has steadily
increased, additions being made at every meeting, until now
we are thirty in number. We follow, with slight variation, the
programs laid out in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>. The chemical experiments
are performed, and the Bryant memorial day was
observed. We are young yet, but we start out under quite favorable
auspices, having an intelligent and enthusiastic president,
and a circle of busy, wide-awake members. You may hear
from us again.”——Last year a few persons at <span class="smcap">Rockville,
Connecticut</span>, subscribed for <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span> and read its
numbers with growing interest. This year the fervor was unabated,
and steps were taken in October to organize a local
circle. They number at present thirty-one members, including
one or two graduates—twenty-five belonging to the general
Circle, class of ’88. The present prospect is of much
profit and real enjoyment in the literary field, during the winter
months.——In the quiet old town of <span class="smcap">Bristol, Rhode
Island</span>, upon the borders of the beautiful Narragansett,
a number of persons have been pursuing the Chautauqua
course of reading by themselves. “Last autumn the idea of
forming a local circle was advanced. A preliminary meeting
was held October 23d, and the ten Chautauquans present
agreed to form a circle. As we are all busy people, with no
spare time, we shall hold our meetings but once a month, but
we intend to make every meeting a decided success. As Bristol
is noted for having within its limits the classic hill where
Philip—not of Macedon, but of Narragansett—lived and died,
we call ours the ‘Mount Hope’ circle. We hold our meetings
at private residences, as this gives them a more social air, and
those who have any part assigned them feel more at ease than
if in a public hall. At our meeting on November 13th, twenty-one
members were present, and responded to roll-call by quotations
from Greek authors. Brief papers were read upon
mythological events; an interesting biographical sketch of
Bryant was also read, and a humorous poem, written for the
occasion. Vocal and instrumental music also found a place.
The enthusiasm manifested was a promise of future success.
The ‘Mount Hope’ circle is exceptionally fortunate in having
for its president, Mr. George W. Arnold, the librarian of our excellent
‘Rogers Free Library.’ His familiarity with this choice
collection of books, and his ability to place before us just the
reference needed at any time, is of inestimable value to us as
readers and students. We have, in our membership, representatives
from every Protestant church in town. Many of us
are teachers, either in the Sunday-school or in public schools,
or in both. We are confident that the C. L. S. C. is a power
for good, and in the words of an old Sunday-school hymn,
‘We’re glad we’re in this army.’”——In that pleasant summer
resort by the sea, <span class="smcap">Westhampton, N. Y.</span>, a few “Pansies”
have been studying together, but this year they generously
opened their doors, and by their genial influence have drawn
together a pleasant set of twenty-one young people. Much
good is naturally looked for from this circle. “Already,” writes
a friend, “beneficial results are manifest.”——At <span class="smcap">Buffalo, N.
Y.</span>, the “Alyssum,” an offshoot from the old circle in that city,
has been well organized. They have a plan in their program
committee which seems practical. At each meeting a new
member is appointed. The former chairman drops out and the
next in order takes the position. In this way each member
of said committee becomes chairman in turn, serves at three
committee meetings, and those who have never done such
work have the advantage of seeing how others do before their
turn comes. It works admirably. Each member is assessed
ten cents a month for the nine months. The circle has decided
it shall be the social duty of each member unable to be
present to send notice of such absence to the hostess of the
evening.——A fine compliment, evidently deserved, is paid
the circle at <span class="smcap">Scranton, Pa.</span>, in the following letter: “It affords
us pleasure to report the formation of a C. L. S. C. in <span class="smcap">Pittston,
Pa.</span> We have long felt the need of such an organization,
but it was at a parlor entertainment given by the ‘Vincent’ C.
L. S. C. of Scranton that we fully determined to have one of
our own, and we are indebted to that circle for help and encouragement
received in forming our circle. Ours, known as
the ‘Riverside’ C. L. S. C., was organized in September, and
has already reached the limit of its membership—twenty. We
meet on Monday evening of each week, at the home of one of
the members, and follow the program given in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>.
We are all delighted with the work, and are already
satisfied that the time spent in the pursuance of the course
could not be spent more profitably.”</p>

<p>Another new Chautauqua circle is reported in <span class="smcap">Sullivan,
Ohio</span>, from which place a lady writes: “I think our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
members all appreciate the value of this great educational
movement and have the success of the work at heart.
We number but five members, but have met regularly since
October 8th, the time of organization. We celebrated Bryant’s
Day, spending a most delightful evening in the study of Bryant
and his productions.”——A local circle of five members has
entered upon the work of the class of ’88 at <span class="smcap">Montezuma, Ind.</span>
Full of enthusiasm for the present, and determination for the
future, we do not for a moment doubt that they will be able
to accomplish the good report which they express themselves
so anxious to have ready in 1888.——Two readers in the village
of <span class="smcap">Onarga, Ill.</span>, last year, were the leaven from which
has risen this year a prosperous circle of eighteen members.
Busy mothers and teachers, young ladies at home, and one
professor make up their membership. Their methods and
plans we hope to hear of in the year.——Three new circles
are reported from <span class="smcap">Michigan</span>: The “Mayflower” of twenty-two
members, all “Plymouth Rocks,” at <span class="smcap">Schoolcraft</span>, where,
as they write, they are brimming over with Chautauqua enthusiasm;
a circle of a dozen energetic young people organized
by the Rev. and Mrs. L. F. Bickford, at <span class="smcap">Pontiac</span>, and at
<span class="smcap">Climax</span> a very enthusiastic circle of ten members organized
in October through the effort of J. H. Brown, a member of
the class of ’86; the nine remaining members belong to the
class of ’88. They follow the plan given for local circles in <span class="smcap">The
Chautauquan</span>.——Two circles are reported from <span class="smcap">Iowa</span>—a
state which always has a C. L. S. C. report. At <span class="smcap">Cherokee</span>,
owing to the energetic efforts of a young lady graduate from
the State Normal, a local circle of eleven members was organized
on Bryant’s Day. Though the plans of the infant association
are still indefinite, great hopes are entertained of its
ultimate success. From <span class="smcap">Alta</span>, also, a friend writes us of the
“Summit Gleaners,” a society lately organized. They began
with four members, but have quickly increased to eleven, and
hope for more. Two or three of their circle are members of
the “Pansy” class; the rest are of the class of ’88. They follow
the course prescribed in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span> as near as
possible, for, as they write, they find it better than anything
they can suggest.——In October last a local circle was organized
in <span class="smcap">Eureka Springs, Arkansas</span>. Special credit is due
the Presbyterian minister of the place for working up an interest
in the “Chautauqua Idea.” He undertook it at the suggestion
of an earnest Christian lady belonging to his church,
who has been reading the C. L. S. C. books for more than a
year. They have in the circle thirty members, nearly all of
whom are reading the books, and more are joining all the
time. The circle is popular. The course of reading is well
received by their most intelligent people.——<span class="smcap">Missouri</span> presents
the last new circle—a class of seven members formed at
<span class="smcap">Mound City</span>. The books have been secured, and they are
now ready for work. All have started with a determination to
finish the four years’ course.</p>

<p>The circles of other years are writing us of much that is interesting
and suggestive. Many of their bits of circle history
and circle social life are so good that we feel a little envious;
for example, of the good fortune of the circle at <span class="smcap">Brantford,
Ontario, Canada</span>, where they were recently honored by a
visit from Chancellor Vincent. The organization at Brantford,
which town, by the way, is a former reserve of the
Six Nations, dates from October, 1883, and numbers twenty-one
members; “up to the standard” they must be, for they
write: “Last month we tried some of the chemical experiments
given in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>, some of which proved
quite successful. Another evening we tested an experiment
made by our hostess in cooking potatoes after one of the rules
given in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>, and they were pronounced by
all to be excellent.”</p>

<p>A name we have, too, this month, which is particularly pleasing
to those of us who read the “Art Readings” of last year.
It is the “Dorionic” Circle, of <span class="smcap">Biddeford, Maine</span>. From its
start the circle has been much interested in Greek history and
literature. In comparing the two leading types of Grecian
character, the Doric and the Ionic each found enthusiastic
champions. Excellent qualities were discerned in both, and
in recognition of the value of the combination the circle decided
to call itself “Dorionic.” This circle, formed November,
1883, has had a prosperous and pleasant experience. It now
numbers sixty, with new members coming in every evening. The
Bryant memorial exercises were of special interest. The president
of this circle is the Rev. B. P. Snow, president of the
class of ’86.</p>

<p>The “Alpha” circle, of <span class="smcap">Rutland, Vt.</span>, has entered upon
its fourth year full of zeal and enthusiasm. They commenced
the year’s reading promptly on the first of October. In her
report, the secretary gives an account of their special features.
“We all craved additional information about the great men in
Roman history, so at our last meeting we had five-minute
sketches of Julius Cæsar, Scipio Africanus, Cicero, Camillus,
and Pompey, and at our next meeting are to have as many
more. We are also to have an essay on Roman women. A
new feature with us is the question-box. Each member is requested
to hand in one question upon some given subject,
these are distributed and answered at the next succeeding
meeting. We observed Bryant’s Memorial and passed a delightful
evening.”</p>

<p>The vigorous circle which sprang into existence at the beginning
of the year of ’83-’84 at <span class="smcap">East Weymouth, Mass.</span>, has
had this year a very marked increase in its members. A public
meeting was called early in October and its effects were
soon evident in the dozen new names which were added to
their roll. Much of the energy with which the circle has been
enabled to begin its work is attributed to the inspiration which
the members who visited the Framingham Assembly gathered
from its inspiring meetings. This spirit seems to have spread
through all New England. The circles are teeming with new
ideas and swelling with numbers. At <span class="smcap">Gloucester, Mass.</span>,
where the “Prospect” C. L. S. C. was organized in 1883, they
have a membership of nineteen, and have begun the year expecting
large things in the future. At <span class="smcap">Reading, Mass.</span>, a
“Triangle” of young ladies is meeting fortnightly to compare
notes and talk over the readings. They find the course valuable,
and send us the encouraging word that soon they hope to
unite the several readers in the town into a circle. And the
“Hurlbut” circle of <span class="smcap">East Boston</span> are writing a book—“A Cyclopædia
of Animal Life.” Each member in turn prepares his
or her paper with a good deal of care, obtaining information
from standard works of reference. The writer must confine
himself to four pages—letter paper size—and as he is expected
to describe two representatives of the animal kingdom within
this compass, he must select the most important and interesting
characteristics, and condense his statements. The Cyclopædia
is necessarily limited—but ten representatives of each
letter of the alphabet. The members of the “Hurlbut” circle
are learning strange and beautiful things concerning animal
life.</p>

<p>Some of the “old circles” are new to us. Such is the
one at <span class="smcap">New Canaan, Conn.</span>, whence a friend writes: “You
ought to have been informed last year of the existence of a
flourishing C. L. S. C. in this place. We have twenty members,
with the promise of others. Our meetings are both pleasant
and profitable, each member faithfully doing his part. During
the past year we had some very interesting programs. Our
members are enjoying the work. We are greatly pleased with
<span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>.” The growth and energy started during
the summer is not confined to New England, either. There is
a word from <span class="smcap">Long Island</span>, which is as ringing as any Framingham
report. It comes from <span class="smcap">East Norwich</span>, where the circle
was reorganized this year with a regular membership of
eighteen. Their meetings are held in a very pleasant school
house, and are rapidly increasing in interest. They take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
great pride in the circle, which they rightly consider one of
the best in the land.</p>

<p>At <span class="smcap">Caledonia, N. Y.</span>, the year-old circle has returned to
work. Nearly all the old members are back, and several new
ones have joined, swelling the membership to twenty-seven.
They must thoroughly enjoy the course, for they do all the work.
The secretary informs us that the “Temperance Teachings of
Science” have evoked quite a lively and interesting discussion
which was entered into by nearly all present. They expect
that some time during the winter they will be favored with some
interesting chemical experiments, performed by a prominent
chemist of Rochester.</p>

<p>The local circle at <span class="smcap">Harrisburg, Pa.</span>, was reorganized on
September 30th, with an increased membership, the total
number now being fifty, of which thirty-one are new members.
Although the meetings of last year were very interesting
and profitable, those of this year bid fair to surpass
them in every way. The members appear to have decided to
do thorough work and already its effect can be seen upon the
meetings. The programs are varied and take in as much of
the month’s readings as it is possible to crowd in and yet do
justice to all.</p>

<p>Eleven large circles are registered in <span class="smcap">Washington, D. C.</span>
Each month we hear some good thing from them. An item
from the Washington <i>Evening Star</i> says of the “Union” circle:
“With the approach of the winter season the literary
and social clubs of the city begin to attract attention, and none
have begun the season’s work with more vim than the Chautauqua
Literary and Scientific Circles, of which there are now
several in the city, all owing allegiance to the central organization,
whose headquarters are at Plainfield, New Jersey. One
of the oldest of these Chautauqua organizations in the city is
‘Union’ circle, which meets every Thursday evening at the
residence of the president. It has a total of nearly thirty
members, all of whom are enthusiastic in the work, and each
meeting’s exercises are of an interesting character. Some of
the members of ‘Union’ circle will graduate in the four
years’ course of reading next year.” And the secretary of
“Foundry” circle writes: “‘Foundry’ local circle, of this city,
enters upon the third year of its existence with thirty-five enthusiastic
members. Our meetings are held weekly in the
parlor of Foundry M. E. Church. We have followed some
of the programs for weekly meetings in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>,
and have had interesting meetings. The evening of October
27th was given up to chemistry, Prof. Israel, of the Washington
High School, delivering an interesting lecture on the
subject, and performing the experiments explained in <span class="smcap">The
Chautauquan</span> for October, and some others not mentioned
there.”</p>

<p>A new circle at <span class="smcap">Kalamazoo, Mich.</span>, has led the former
organization to adopt the title of “Alpha” circle. This latter
is a very lively body, we judge from their report. Their reorganization
was a time for a general meeting, to which invitations
were issued. So well has the year started off that the
secretary writes: “Our past four meetings have been so very
enjoyable that the closing hour—ten o’clock—comes only too
soon. One feature of the evenings which has caused us the
greatest sport has been the ‘pronouncing’ match (also ‘questions
and answers’ match), which was carried on as a spelling
match, choosing sides, etc.; the one who first takes his seat
through failure must favor the society with a song, suggested
by the fortunate one. The roll-call responded to by quotations,
as suggested in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>, monthly report, essays
and impromptu speeches form pleasing variety. A speech on
a given subject is required as penalty for former absence.
Then, too, the music! How we enjoy that part of the program!
As our musical committee varies each Monday evening, singing
or playing often falls to the lot of non-musicians, who
amuse us by compliance; on one occasion an organ grinder’s
instrument was secured for the evening’s entertainment.”</p>

<p>An Egyptian campaign in the interests of the C. L. S. C. is
being organized at <span class="smcap">Metropolis</span>, in <span class="smcap">Illinois</span>. Have they a
Chinese Gordon, we wonder, to conduct their forces? They
must have a leader as efficient, surely, for they write that their
circle, strengthened by a goodly increase, organized promptly
at the beginning of the year, that their former members belonging
to the class of ’86 are becoming more in earnest as the
year advances, and that they are planning to go down into
Egypt, an expedition which has the heartiest good wishes of
us all.——At <span class="smcap">Aurora, Ill.</span>, too, a campaign was planned for
the fall, which proved most successful. The secretary of the
“First” circle of that city, while at Chautauqua, planned a
Round-Table, at which the three circles should unite in
celebrating “Opening Day.” A very entertaining program was
prepared, and Chancellor Vincent kindly wrote them a letter of
greeting; the hope that the circle had had of increasing their
membership by this union meeting was not disappointed.
Aurora now boasts <i>five</i> circles, each numbering from eighteen
to twenty members.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Illinois</span> also sends us a chapter of history this month which
is very good reading. It is from the <span class="smcap">Winchester</span> circle: “Our
circle has just entered its fourth year’s work, with nine members.
Having consisted mainly, in previous years, of teachers,
our number has been fluctuating. Since October, 1880, we
have enrolled eighteen names, nearly all of whom proved
zealous workers. At present we have only two of the original
number, who are called the ‘Veterans.’ During the summer
of 1881 two of our members went on to attend the convention;
that of 1882 was spent by three of them on ‘A Tour Around
the World,’ in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>; and the recent vacation,
that of 1883, was devoted to the ‘Art Papers’ of last year; by
the way, when those appeared in the journal, they seemed so
fully to meet the wants of some of the members that an ‘Art
Branch’ was promptly organized and a thorough study of the
subject commenced. As we took up each artist separately,
and only held our branch meetings every two weeks, we did
not finish with the year’s work, nor are we through yet, having
gotten as far as Rubens in the May number of 1884. We feel
repaid a thousand times for doing the extra work. Last year
Prof. J. M. Crow, of Grinnell, Iowa, a student of Leipsic University,
and a gentleman who has made several trips to Europe,
lectured for us on ‘Greece and the Parthenon.’ This year we
propose to hold an extra meeting each month, invite our friends
in, and thus strive to convince them that the C. L. S. C. work
is <i>not superficial</i> (as some have the impression). We defend
our <i>Alma Mater</i> from the attacks of the skeptical, with almost
as much energy as ‘Horatius held the bridge,’ and trust we are
laying the foundation for a circle that will flourish in the
future. Our president and others of the class hope to represent
us at Chautauqua next summer. Miss M. Huston, our former
enthusiastic president, is now a teacher in California, whither
she has doubtless carried the C. L. S. C. spirit. Since taking
up the course, the hitherto dismal days of fall have become
golden ones, and life has grown sweeter, brighter and
better.”</p>

<p>A local circle was organized in the little village of <span class="smcap">Blue
Earth City, Minn.</span>, several months since, with about ten
members, now increased to thirteen. They meet every Tuesday
evening at the house of some member. Their reading is
confined to the magazine principally; each gives some item
of news at the opening of the meeting, then questions are
asked on the preceding lesson, and persons are appointed to
look up and report at the next meeting any subject which may
arise in connection with the lesson. They are all greatly interested
and feel that the meetings are a benefit, as well as a
help in cultivating among the members a better acquaintance
and more friendly relations.</p>

<p>From <span class="smcap">Fairfield, Iowa</span>, a friend writes: “We would like
to report ourselves as living and active in our work. This new
year has opened auspiciously. Our circle numbers twenty-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
are not found outside the C. L. S. C. We are known as the
‘Hawkeye Arc,’ have our meetings weekly and hope to greatly
profit by the studies of the year. We have met a serious loss
in the death of our president, Mrs. T. D. Ewing, the wife of
the president of Parson’s College, of this place. She was a
lady of culture and liberal education, and gave her best
efforts to the advancement of the C. L. S. C. in this, her
adopted home. But we are glad that while many of our associates
are called to ‘come up higher,’ the work does not
languish and is still exerting the beneficent influence of this
wonderful band of reading ones.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norfolk, Nebraska</span>, is as far as we can go west this month.
A live, enterprising circle at that point is working with a western
vim. They seem to take a rather unusual pride in being
“like everybody else,” but when we remember the points of
resemblance, it is not surprising that they should be proud.
They send word: “All bear stories open with ‘once upon a
time,’ so all reports of C. L. S. C.s read, ‘Our circle was organized
on such an evening, and consists of lawyers, doctors,
bankers, ministers, merchants, and their wives and daughters;
all intelligent, enthusiastic workers,’ etc. Ours is no exception
to this rule. We have twenty-five members with three officers,
president, vice, and secretary. As variety hath charms, our
president is authorized to appoint a new leader for each evening,
and as no two men or women of different professions have
minds made after the same mould, we succeed in the <i>variety</i>.
Especially do we succeed in this particular, when we undertake
to pronounce the Greek words found in the readings.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Letters are coming to the secretary from members in all
parts of the United States—Kentucky, Maryland, Pennsylvania,
Indiana, Ohio, Minnesota and Iowa being represented,
and the indications are, the “Invincibles” will not be “lost
in the woods” in August ’85. Those who attended the camp-fire
last season at Chautauqua will appreciate the foregoing
phrase.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One enthusiastic young lady writes: “I have read the course
alone, could not form here even a ‘straight line’ or a ‘triangle;’”
another, “I am alone in my studies, but hope to meet
and greet my fellow-laborers ‘under the arches.’” Such
courage is truly “Invincible” and should be rewarded by an
extra seal.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Letters ending “Your Chautauqua friend,” “hoping to
clasp hands with you at Chautauqua in August ’85,” etc., make
one feel “Chautauqua” is the magic word that draws us together
as links in the great C. L. S. C. chain, and that friendships
formed through its medium may continue even after we
have “finished our course.” “For so the whole round earth
is every way bound by gold chains about the feet of God.”</p>

<p><i>President</i>—The Rev. B. P. Snow, Biddeford, Maine.</p>

<p><i>Vice Presidents</i>—The Rev. J. C. Whitley, Salisbury, Maryland; Mr. L.
F. Houghton, Peoria, Illinois; Mr. Walter Y. Morgan, Cleveland,
Ohio; Mrs. Delia Browne, Louisville, Kentucky; Miss Florence Finch,
Palestine, Texas.</p>

<p><i>Secretary</i>—The Rev. W. L. Austin, Dunkirk, New York.</p>

<h4>NEW ENGLAND ORGANIZATION.</h4>

<p>Class Headquarters was a new and most pleasant feature at
Framingham last summer, and one which the limited hall
accommodations rendered a necessity. The class tent was
tastefully decorated, and over the entrance was displayed the
device of the class—a hand passing a lighted torch to another
hand—with the class motto, “We study for light to bless with
light.” The committee having the matter in charge hope to
provide suitable accommodations for the class at the Assembly
next season.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A very pleasant reunion was held in Normal Hall, Thursday,
July 24, at 10 a. m. The exercises consisted of an address
by the president, the Rev. B. P. Snow, of Biddeford, Me.,
and stirring speeches by representatives from several states,
with reading of original and selected articles. A most interesting
item on the program was the reading of the well known
poem, “No sect in Heaven,” by Mr. C. Cleveland, of Hartford,
Conn., son of the authoress, who is also a member of the class.
Miss Gelia H. Tewkesbury (Helen Hawthorne) was unanimously
elected class poetess. Hon. Wm. Claflin, ex-Governor of
Massachusetts, was made an honorary member of the class.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Six hundred and forty-eight names from one hundred and
seventy-three towns are now enrolled, only a fraction of the
whole number. Will all members of Class ’86 in New England,
who have not yet registered, please send their names and
address, stating whether they are studying alone or in a circle,
and the name of the circle, to the New England Secretary at
their earliest convenience?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following officers were elected for the ensuing year:</p>

<p>President, the Rev. B. P. Snow, Biddeford, Me.; Vice Presidents,
Miss Emily Jordan, Alfred, Me., Edwin F. Reeves, Laconia,
N. H., the Rev. J. H. Babbitt, Swanton, Vt., Chas. Wainwright,
Lawrence, Mass., H. Howard Pepper, Providence, R. I., the Rev.
A. Gardner, Buckingham, Conn.; Secretary and Treasurer,
Mary R. Hinckley, New Bedford, Mass.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A new badge bearing the emblem of the class is proposed.
If it is adopted further particulars will be given hereafter.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ida M. Grisell, of the class of ’86, died at her home in Upper
Sandusky, Ohio, June 30, 1884. She was an enthusiastic
Chautauquan, having remarked shortly before her death that
life seemed so much more worth living since she had taken
the course.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<h3>CLASS OF ’87—“THE PANSIES.”</h3>

<p>From De Soto, Mo., comes news of most vigorous work in
the C. L. S. C., a large circle of enterprising members and a
program for the observance of the Bryant Day, that tells of a
meeting of rare interest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Rev. N. B. Fisk, of Woburn, Mass., class of ’87, is the
secretary and treasurer of the Board of Trustees who have in
hand the erection of the “Hall on the Hill” for New England’s
accommodation at Framingham.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the November number of <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span> the New
England branch of the Class of ’87 was given three presidents.
The Rev. F. M. Gardner, of Lawrence, Mass., is the
president; the other two names should have been grouped
with the vice presidents.</p>

<p>Newspaper notices of C. L. S. C. work sometimes do more
than we expect. Circles in the country and smaller towns
read programs of meetings and other Chautauqua items with
a good deal of interest, and often get encouragement from seeing
what others are doing. The papers are glad to get the
notices. We advise circles to use them freely, and to publish
in their local papers notices of the memorial days, with a list
of the reading for those days. Try it.</p>

<p>The “Pansy” bed at Chautauqua, projected as a testimonial
improvement by the class of ’87, is in the hands of a committee
who are to secure a good location and carry the matter to completion.
It will be placed near the Amphitheater, a little
toward Mrs. Alden’s cottage. Already a number of most exquisite
designs have been furnished by widely separated
members of the class. When agreed upon the description will
be given in our column.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One New England minister, who is a member of ’87, writes:
“I consider this Chautauqua business a part of my pastoral
duties; it is so saturated with the spirit of Jesus, emanating
from such a consecrated man as Dr. Vincent, and comprehending
so much of the devotional, aggressive, and persuasive
in religion. I have a Congregational church in a hotbed of
infidelity and heresy, and can see very plainly that such books
as ‘Philosophy of the Plan of Salvation’ and ‘Evidences,’ together
with the devout spirit of the whole plan, are making an
impression among the skeptical and shaking them somewhat
in their infidel intrenchments.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A Michigan mother nearly sixty years old writes a letter,
touchingly grateful that the C. L. S. C. was ever organized.
She has two sons who are members with her of the class of ’87,
and who are herders of cattle in New Mexico. She says no
one can appreciate her joy at the assurance that they are held
by their reading to the improvement of their time, and thus
escape the evils that work the ruin of many boys away from
home. She with them forms a circle. Their meetings are only
through correspondence. Neither has ever seen Chautauqua,
or any other summer Assembly, but they bless the plan of improvement
whose privileges they share.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Among pleasant C. L. S. C. experiences which are found
among the members of ’87, as among those of the other classes,
is the case of an engineer on the railway west from Chicago.
The last argument he made to his wife why he could not join
the class and do the reading was that he would unavoidably
so soil his books that she could not tolerate them in their cosy
cottage home. She said, “Try it, and I will clean every soiled
page the year through and have them tastily on our little
shelves.” He agreed to undertake it. She found no small
task upon her hands, but she did it by pinching her allowance
to the purchase of a duplicate for each successive book, to
which joyous accomplishment on her part her husband points
with pride in his growing library.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Quite a large proportion of the class are going on with the
reading this second year. But the number can be increased
by a little personal effort on the part of those who have the
C. L. S. C. enthusiasm. See that your book stores keep the
books ready for sale. See that each member has one of the
C. L. S. C. circulars for 1884-5, so that they may not be in any
doubt about what the reading for each month is. Help them
about sending for <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span> by forming a club and
sending together, thus saving expense. Some fail to send in
their annual fees, but go on with the reading. Secretaries of
circles should collect the annual fees of 50 cents, and send on
by check or postoffice order to Plainfield. By attending to
these matters some will be kept in the ranks who would otherwise
fall behind. If any one can not do the prescribed reading
just as directed in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>, week by week or
day by day, let such try to keep a little in advance, rather than
behind. The officers of circles ought to keep in advance especially,
so as to be ready to arrange some parts of the program
for the future meetings of their circles.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The most of the more than two hundred ’87s whose names
were registered at Chautauqua, this year, promised to write
Mrs. Alden, Carbondale, Pa.—“Pansy”—a letter of incident
in the work, she most kindly indicating her willingness
to write a book, dedicated to the class. It’s one thing to
promise, another to perform, and while we could not think of
a Chautauquan who would not do as they agree, the secretaries
of ’87, with the president, are very anxious to know if Mrs.
Alden has received nearly two hundred letters. Early in the
new year the class officials will write to Carbondale to know
if all the promises have been made good. Mrs. Alden’s book
will be grand, every one of her more than fifty books are excellent.
Let every one of us who promised do gladly all that
we promised and more.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The ’87 badges were noticeably fine at Chautauqua last
year, and every reader in that great class should have this
badge. They should be worn uniformly at the circles and on
all memorial days. Class love (call it pride if you will) is important
indeed; it can scarcely be overestimated. You are
and can be in but one class, and that is the class to you, and
will be all through life. ’87 “Pansy” class is yours, and
you love your classmates, and you are deeply interested in
every one of them, and will be all along down through life.
It is true that the first great class (in numbers at least) is ’87,
and while we hope ’88 and ’89 and ’90 will every way excel it,
it still remains for us of ’87 to make the most of every hour.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Miss Ellen A. Shaw, of Keeseville, N. Y., a member of the
C. L. S. C., of the class of ’87, entered “that school where she
no longer needs our poor protection, but Christ himself doth
rule,” on September 30, 1884, aged nineteen years. They had
been “nineteen beautiful years,” exceptionally happy to herself,
and the source of great pleasure to all her friends. Graduating
from the High School in Keeseville in June, 1884, she
immediately took up the Chautauqua Idea, and began the
prescribed course in October following. She enjoyed it exceedingly,
interested others in it, read carefully, and made her
memoranda and reports faithfully until her strength failed, and
she laid down her hopes of earthly improvement, with brighter
ones of the country where our mental powers know no fatigue
or decay.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At a meeting of the “Bryant” circle of Worcester, Mass.,
C. L. S. C., October 7th, 1884, the following memorial was
adopted: “<i>Whereas</i>, It has pleased our Heavenly Father to
remove from our circle one of our beloved members, Miss Effie
C. Warner, of the class of ’87, we desire to express our appreciation
of her character and her worth as a member of our
circle. Her presence was always welcomed with pleasure, and
our meetings were made interesting by her fine musical attainments,
which she was ever ready to devote to the cause she
loved. While we mourn her loss, we bow in submission to the will
of him who ‘doeth all things well.’ We are thankful for her
pure, gentle life, and feel sure that its influence will long be
felt in our circle.”</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<h4>II.—FIFTY QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON “THE CHARACTER OF
JESUS.”</h4>

<p>51. Q. What is the design of the author in the argument of
the book under consideration? A. To show the self-evidencing,
superhuman character of Christ, forbidding his possible
classification with men.</p>

A. That they deal in supernatural events and transactions, and
show the fact of a celestial institution finally erected on earth.</p>

Christ, and with him the entire fabric either stands or falls.</p>

<p>54. Q. In the argument, what is, and what is not assumed, in

is not assumed, but only the representations themselves as being
just what they are.</p>

affinity or oneness with God.</p>

<p>63. Q. What is there peculiar in the passive side of the character

generally, Christ connects the non-resisting and gentle passivities
with a character of the severest grandeur and majesty.</p>

the passion of Christ? A. A character which separates

scheme of social regeneration to begin? A. With the higher
classes, and through them operate its results.</p>

<p>71. Q. How is the more than human character of Jesus further
displayed in his thus identifying himself with the poor?
A. In the fact that he was yet able to do it without eliciting any
feeling of partisanship in them.</p>

A. The perfect originality and independence of his teaching.</p>

of his times? A. He was perfectly clear of all the current superstitions.</p>

<p>78. Q. Of what did Christ never take the ground or boast the
distinction? A. Of a liberal among his countrymen.</p>

<p>79. Q. What is a remarkable and even superhuman distinction
of Jesus in regard to the simplicity of his teachings? A.
While he is advancing doctrines so far transcending all deductions
of philosophy, and opening mysteries that defy all human
powers of explication, he is yet able to set his teachings in
a form of simplicity that accommodates all classes of minds.</p>

<p>80. Q. What form for truth was Jesus first able to find? A.
A form for truth adequate to all the world’s uses.</p>

<p>81. Q. What is the character of the God that Christ revealed?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>

embrace with a faith that unifies them all.</p>

<p>82. Q. In what has the morality of Jesus a potential superiority
to that of all human teachers? A. In the fact that it is
not an artistic or theoretically elaborated scheme, but one that
is propounded in precepts that carry their own evidence.</p>

<p>83. Q. What is a high distinction of Christ’s character as
seen in his teachings? A. That he is never anxious for the
success of his doctrines.</p>

<p>84. Q. In what was the character of Jesus different from that
of all the mere men of the race as shown by familiarity? A.
Instead of being reduced in eminence, as human characters
are, it was raised and made sacred by familiarity.</p>

<p>85. Q. What two questions now remain which the argument
of the author requires to be answered? A. Did any such being
as Jesus actually exist? and, if so, was he a sinless character?</p>

<p>86. Q. What can we believe more easily than that Christ
was a man, and yet a perfect character, such as here given?
A. We can believe any miracle more easily.</p>

<p>87. Q. If Jesus was a sinner, of what was he conscious? A.
He was conscious of sin, as all sinners are, and, therefore, was
a hypocrite in the whole fabric of his character.</p>

<p>88. Q. What would such an example of successful hypocrisy
be of itself? A. The greatest miracle ever heard of in the
world.</p>

<p>89. Q. What is Mr. Parker’s estimate of the doctrine of
Christ? A. “He pours out a doctrine beautiful as the light,
sublime as heaven, and true as God.”</p>

<p>90. Q. What is the first conclusion reached by our author in
his argument? A. That Christ actually lived and bore the real
character ascribed to him in history.</p>

<p>91. Q. What is the second conclusion? A. That he was a
sinless character.</p>

<p>92. Q. What is it incredible and contrary to reason to suppose
of a being out of humanity? A. That he will be shut up
within all the limitations of humanity.</p>

<p>93. Q. Jesus being a miracle himself, if he did not work
miracles what would it be? A. It would be the greatest of all
miracles.</p>

<p>94. Q. What is said of the mythical hypothesis to account
for the Christian miracles advanced by the critics who deny
them? A. It is itself impossible.</p>

<p>95. Q. What have the evangelists been able to give us concerning
Christ? A. A doctrine upon which the world has
never advanced, and a character so deep that the richest
hearts have felt nothing deeper, and added nothing to the sentiment
of it.</p>

<p>96. Q. Of what are these mighty works of Jesus, which have
been done and duly certified, a fit expression to us? A. Of
the fact that he can do for us all that we want.</p>

<p>97. Q. What does our author call the spirit of Jesus unabridged?
A. The great miracle of Christianity.</p>

<p>98. Q. What only can draw the soul to faith, and open it to
the power of a supernatural and new-creative mercy? A.
Nothing but to say, “Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of
God by miracles and signs which God did by him.”</p>

<p>99. Q. In what way are all the conditions of life raised by
the advent of Jesus? A. By the meaning he has shown to be
in them, and the grace he has put upon them.</p>

<p>100. Q. What does our author say it would be easier to do
than to get the character of Jesus out of the world? A. It
were easier to untwist all the beams of light in the sky, separating
and expunging one of the colors.</p>

<h3>THE CORRESPONDENCE SCHOOLS.</h3>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">BY PROF. R. S. HOLMES, A.M.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>“What is the relation of the Correspondence Schools to the
University?”</p>

<p>“I am a member of the Correspondence Class in German;
am I also a member of the University?”</p>

<p>Correspondents have recently asked these questions. They
are important enough to receive public answer, since they
represent many of the same import. They exhibit an uncertainty
concerning the relation of the University to other Chautauqua
institutions, which should be removed. To accomplish
it is our present purpose.</p>

<p>We answer the first easily. There is no relation between
the University and the Correspondence Schools; the latter
have ceased to exist as separate institutions. We answer the
second easily, though this answer may seem to contradict the
former. A member of the Correspondence Class in German
is, and is not, a member of the University. Both answers are
true. The separate existence of the Correspondence School
has ceased, but its existence in the University as the College
of Modern Languages continues.</p>

<p>Again, although members of the Correspondence School are
thus in the University, they are not matriculated members, not
having met the matriculation requirement. The faculty is
unchanged. Dr. Worman directs the College of Modern Languages;
Prof. Lalande the Department of French.</p>

<p>But the answers thus given do not meet the spirit of the
questions. To do this we must review the history which has
resulted in the Chautauqua University. The Chautauqua
Summer School of Languages held its first session in the summer
of 1879. It made no claim to originality. It was among
the earlier of these popular schools, and has achieved an enviable
reputation. It ranged itself from the outset on the side of
the so called “new education.” It adopted the system of Pestalozzi,
and announced to the world the opening of a school for
instruction in language by the natural method. Six schools
were organized with a brilliant corps of teachers. After the
lapse of six years, it is the candid judgment of a careful observer,
that better teaching has never been done on this continent
than was done in that first session of the Chautauqua
Summer School. The original heads of the French and German
Schools still occupy their positions with honor alike to
themselves and to Chautauqua, while the standard of excellence
has never been higher than at the present hour.</p>

<p>The session of the Summer School lasted for six weeks. It
early became evident that these six weeks must in some way
be supplemented if the student was to make any lasting acquisition.
To meet this necessity members of the school were
advised to continue their work at home, and were assured that
needed aid would be rendered by correspondence by their
department professors. The attempt was made. It failed.
The causes were numerous. There was the lack of the teacher’s
presence, and of a bond of union. Professional duties
claimed the teacher’s time. Acquaintance had been too brief
to create even personal interest of teacher in pupil. The student
had no incentive to persistent effort, there was a lamentable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
want of system, and the correspondence was irregular and
unsatisfactory. It failed; but failure is not the end of Chautauqua
enterprises. Another year witnessed another effort for
an after-school course of study. One person was selected to
receive all inquiries from the students, to forward them to the
respective teachers, and to secure from the teachers prompt
attention. This attempt failed; but failure brought yet deeper
conviction that there were great possibilities in the after-school
idea, if only a true method of work could be found. There
were a few patient students who had persevered notwithstanding
the difficulties. Something must be provided for them.
After much deliberation a plan for Correspondence Schools
was adopted. There was to be a regular course of study, lasting
from October to July. Ten dollars was to be the annual
tuition fee. Each professor was pledged to a definite amount
of work, and each school was to have the benefit of the Chautauqua
name; but there was no homogeneity. Each professor
was independent of every other, giving attention only to the
details of his own particular school, and with no interest save
his own. The only benefit that could accrue to Chautauqua
was a possible increase in attendance upon the Summer
School.</p>

<p>The plan succeeded. For three years teachers and students
have worked successfully. True, there have been disadvantages.
French and German are living languages. Pronunciation
is difficult even to one trained in language when aided by
a present native teacher. Valuable as the lesson paper may
be in helping to a knowledge of principles and translation, it
can not speak, nor tell another how to speak. Yet it is plain
that one who is correctly trained in principles, and can with
rapidity translate, could easily master pronunciation when once
in contact with the living teacher.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding these difficulties the schools have been
successful. Good work has been done. The students have
made notable progress; and some able to attend the Summer
School, have speedily added to their foundation in principle
the essentials of correct pronunciation. The problem was
solved; but with its solution came another important question.
Why may not all the subjects embraced in a college curriculum
be taught by correspondence? To this there can be but one
answer: There is no reason why any subject may not be so
taught, except such as require the use of instruments and the
performance of experiments; and for these good local instructors
could be obtained. The next and logical step is the incorporation
and organization of the Chautauqua University.</p>

<p>We have now reached a point where a comprehensive answer
can be made to the questions which begin this paper. To
organize the University, the professors identified with the Correspondence
Schools were retained, while the schools themselves,
which had achieved success by efforts of Chautauqua
officials, and through the prestige of the Chautauqua name,
were merged in Chautauqua’s crowning glory—the University.</p>

<p>Henceforth there are no separate and unrelated institutions,
which professors shall control and direct as circumstances
allow; but each is part of one grand institution,
watched over and directed by its Chancellor, and managed
through its central office. All this is effected without prejudice
to any interest. The professor becomes the representative of
an institution which will hereafter be known as the pioneer in
the grandest educational movement of the century. The student,
from an isolated class, is brought into relation with many
other departments of study, with a curriculum which may end
in a diploma and degree. All this has been possible only
through the work which Chautauqua has accomplished. Not
only has it been possible, but possible at a merely nominal
cost. The little tuition charged has gone as an inadequate
compensation to the faithful work of talented teachers. Chautauqua
has received from these sources no pecuniary benefit.
Here is a question for each student of the Correspondence
Schools to ponder: Do I not owe something to the University
in return for the advantages I have enjoyed, and to aid it in
extending them to others? Here, too, is an anomaly: A University
planning the largest educational work, without a dollar
of endowment and with meager provision for necessary expenses.
In addition to the former tuition fee of ten dollars
there is required from all students, before entering, the payment
of a matriculation fee of five dollars. Only those who
have paid this fee are enrolled upon the University books.
This explains the statement already made, that members of
the Correspondence classes were, and were not, members of
the University. There is no purpose to disturb the present
status of the schools of French, German and English. Those
who entered them under the previous arrangement are entitled
to the benefits promised them. Should any student in these
schools feel disposed to aid the work by the payment of the
matriculation fee, proper acknowledgment will be made. It
will not for the present year be required; but with the expiration
of the year, when the obligation between student and
teacher has been met, the University will assert its right to
demand full conformance to its requirements by all who participate
in its privileges. Professors will no longer be burdened
with business details. All fees will be sent to the central
office, and through it students will be introduced to their
professors, and the University will enter upon a future of usefulness
which no forecasting can express.</p>

<h3>PRACTICAL LOYALTY—C. L. S. C. BOOKS.</h3>

<p>The C. L. S. C. text-books are adapted to the peculiar method
of C. L. S. C. work. They are the result of efforts to meet the
wants of the main body of our members, and there has been
no hap-hazard in their selection, but careful, patient and
abundant thoughtfulness. Sometimes a member desires to
substitute some book not in the course for one of ours. Sometimes
his request may be granted; often it may not be
granted. In the first place, it is desirable that there should be
uniformity in the work done, and this we secure, for the most
part, by uniform text-books. In a college, the uniformity is
secured by the living teacher; we must secure ours by the
printed page. Our need of common text-books is therefore
peculiar and imperative. If we granted all the requests for
substitutions which might be made, we should end by frittering
away our course of study. We might seriously impair it by
granting only those requests which seem to those who make
them to be entirely reasonable. There must be hard and fast
lines in any system of instruction; in our system the uniform
text-books make one of those lines. It is our means of keeping
together, of easily communicating with each other, of
simplifying examinations and assisting our members in overcoming
difficulties. In a rare case, a substitution may be
allowed; but the substituted book must be equally good and
equally <i>fresh</i>. Very few old text-books are now good. The
subjects have undergone changes of importance either in the
principles or the modes of illustrating them. A good text-book
must be a fresh book. Furthermore, our books are specially
adapted to private study; the ordinary school-books are made
to be interpreted by a living teacher. The full meaning of
this difference will not be grasped at once by those who have
not thought about it. We have had to think about it. Our
success depended upon our thinking about it to some purpose.
The result of much thinking and careful planning is the Chautauqua
system of text-books. We find it more and more
important to adhere to our own books. <i>The books are our
teachers.</i></p>

<p>We hope, therefore, that those who have desired changes to
meet their special wants will remember the reason why their
wishes can not be consulted. There is a call for loyalty on
their part to the system. It depends on their loving it enough
to forego some personal feelings or interests. We are in
special and numerous ways dependent upon the affectionate
respect of our members for the invisible authority of this institution—just
as colleges depend on a like feeling toward the
visible authority in their work. The colleges select their text-books;
we select ours. In each case, substitutions ought to
be very rare. If the disappointed applicant for a change of
book has a loyal feeling toward the C. L. S. C. he will cheerfully
sacrifice his preferences or his convenience to the welfare
of the whole body. The whole body must move on common
lines to common ends; and the individual members keep step,
because a great army can not march in any other way—the
individual must coöperate in the movement according to a
common plan. We therefore appeal to the loyalty of our
members to aid us in all reasonable ways to maintain our system
of uniform books. We see more clearly than they possibly
can that this uniformity is vital to the C. L. S. C.
organization.</p>

<h3>THE DISHONESTY OF REPUDIATION.</h3>

<p>In the <i>North American Review</i> for December Mr. John F.
Hume repeats his appeal to the honest people of this country
to vindicate the national honor by paying the dishonored
bonds of twelve states. Mr. Hume is severe and almost
bitter; but he tells us some truth which must needs be
unpleasant and should be seriously told. We are in an anomalous
position in the matter of these state debts; the states are
by the eleventh amendment secure from legal pursuit, and the
Union secures them from the forcible settlement which the law
of nations authorizes. There is no doubt that each of these
states would have been seized for debt by foreign powers, just
as Mexico was seized a few years ago, if the national government
did not cover them with its protection. The evil is precisely
this, that the constitution cuts off creditors of states from
any remedy when the states do not pay their debts. This state
of things was brought about by the whole people when the
eleventh amendment was adopted. We are all therefore responsible
for state roguery. We have, though unintentionally,
authorized the repudiation by opening the door to it; and so
long as we leave the door open we are responsible for the rascally
people who repudiate state bonds. We have tried hard
to see some escape from the logic of Mr. Hume; but we have
found none. We are as a nation responsible for the existence
of these dishonored debts, which now exceed three hundred
millions of dollars. We are a dishonest nation; it is a hard
saying, but it is the exact truth of the case.</p>

<p>The logical remedy is the repeal of the eleventh amendment,
but unfortunately there is no hope of that. The
defaulting states are too numerous; and there is further some
doubt whether the rest of us are honest enough to approve
such a reform. Representatives in legislatures and in Congress
are liable to be influenced by a set of considerations
which have no proper relation to the matter. It is affirmed
that the states were wronged by their officers in the issue of
the bonds; that the bonds are now held by men who bought
them for a small part of their face value; and that to pay them
is to honor the rascalities which gave them birth, and reward
speculators in unreasonable measure. If the subject is pressed
upon our attention, we shall be told, and have no reason to
disbelieve it, that the speculators are spending money through
a lobby, and that the road to honor lies through more filth than
is piled up in the path of dishonor. The evil, we shall be told,
is done, and is irremediable. We can not reach the persons
who were really wronged. They have parted with their property
at an almost total sacrifice; the present holders have no
<i>moral</i> rights whatever. All this has been plentifully said, and
it has lulled many consciences to sleep. Another moral opiate
is the <i>fact</i> that the creditors had due notice that the states
could not be sued at law, and therefore can not complain of
this defect in our constitution. But this is a two-edged argument
and might well rouse a sleepy conscience. These state
debts are for this very reason debts of honor, such as honest
men pay before all other debts. And yet, it is true, and pity ’tis
’tis true, no hope exists that the unfortunate amendment can
be repealed. It is perfectly just to say that it would be proper
to accompany the repeal with any legislation which might be
required to enable courts to take account of all the equities in
each case, even to require that original holders of bonds, or
their heirs be found, and that any reduction from par in the
original sales be allowed to the state. It would, in short, be
possible to do justice as exactly as men can do justice in transactions
of this complicated character, and to secure the tax-payers
of the states in default against any oppression. But
the great public is not going to be convinced. It will be said
that the remedial measure is for the relief of idle rich men in
Wall street, and Congressmen and legislators will be warned
not to sign their death warrants. In the course of such a campaign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
so much immorality will be taught, so many men now
decent in life will be manufactured into rascals, that it may be
wiser not to attempt to repeal the eleventh amendment. It is
a disagreeable conclusion to reach, but we reach it frankly:
We are a dishonest nation. There is no reasonable hope,
rather no shadow of hope, that we can purge ourselves in the
matter of dishonored state bonds. There are not enough honest
voters to redeem our reputation. We may succeed in
raising up an honest generation to follow us; for our part, we
of this generation must wear the stigma and groan under the
burden of our dishonor. We are not able to allow creditors of
defaulting states to present their cases to our own courts and
have them passed upon as all other debts are. The nation
has a court to consider claims against itself; but a state is free
of even such supervision, and is authorized to be guilty of any
dishonesty. The other remedy which Mr. Hume proposes is
not practicable for the foregoing reasons. He proposes that
the nation shall assume all these debts. We could easily pay
them; but for that matter, it would be easier for the indebted
states to pay them than not to pay them. No one doubts that
the state of Illinois did the best thing financially when in 1845
it assumed and provided for the crushing debt—for which, by
the way, it had very little to show as value received. Good
men avoid dishonest communities, and such states are resorted
to by men of prey. Granted, however, that we might pass in
Congress the proper bills to pay the dishonored bonds of states,
it would certainly be better to pay thus than to bear our reproach.
And yet this would only give us a short rest. The
next decade would find us plunged back into the gulf of disgrace.
So long as dishonest men can create debts, for which
no one is legally responsible, by using the names of states, the
business of making us all responsible for scoundrelism will go
on. No, we will modify that. The men who made the debts
are not necessarily rascals. They may mean that posterity
shall pay the debts; but so long as a dishonest legislature can
with a stroke of the pen plunge us back into dishonor, it is
hardly worth while to pay the dishonored millions now staring
our consciences in the face and humiliating us to the dust.
The bill for paying off the debts should be contingent on the
repeal of the eleventh amendment. In short, this repeal is the
only road to honor. When we shake ourselves from our rogueries,
we shall have to march to the eleventh amendment and
wash ourselves in a national act of repeal. We write most
sorrowfully our conviction that we shall not for some time rid
ourselves of this uncleanness.</p>

<p>Mr. Hume very properly calls attention to the solemn silence
of our American churches on this subject. We are glad that
he has done so. Our church organizations are verily guilty in
the matter. They often lift up their voices on subjects of far
less obvious and direct moral concernment. We are living in
a state of the national law whose direct effect is to make every
citizen a thief, a partaker with thieves in their violation of the
eighth commandment. Decalogue religion is, we sometimes
fear, a little below par. Thousands of our citizens who are
church members fail miserably in keeping the Decalogue in
their public conduct as voters and members of political parties.
And yet we believe that the silence of our churches is due to
the forgetfulness of the facts, or to despair of any real and
permanent cure. It is a hard case. More than one newspaper
has asked how many bonds Mr. Hume owns; and the
ministers who urge the duty of public honesty will in fact find
themselves aiding and abetting the schemes of Wall street
speculators and lobbyists. The road to righteousness is so
foul and so infested with thieves that sublime courage is necessary
to him who attempts the journey. We have written
every sentence of this article with a consciousness that we are
offending men who see the uncleanness of the path to honor,
and <i>do not</i> see that it is the righteous road in spite of the foul
smells with which it reeks. We recall such to the simple
facts: First, by the eleventh amendment a state can not be
sued. It is the only debt-creating power in the Union which is
above any form of judicial inquiry or compulsion. Even the
Union has a court of claims whose decisions are respected by
Congress. Second, more than three hundred millions of money
is apparently due by defaulting states to their creditors. The
nation stands between the creditors and the states, and bars
the way to the courts. It is our one colossal and unpardonable
crime against the eighth commandment.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<h3>THE FALL IN PRICES.</h3>

<p>It is often disagreeable to admit a plain truth, and there are
truths which one may safely admit in private which have an almost
incendiary character when printed. To admit in private
that the commercial outlook is not good costs nothing; to
print the fact and prove it is to run the risk of aggravating the
causes of the unpromising condition of affairs. The public is
like a patient whose chance of recovery depends upon his not
knowing his critical condition. If his nerves get to playing
around that danger, they may drag him into it. To state in
printed words that the times are bad and growing worse might
be to tell a truth; but it would tend to produce the worse times.
This is the reason why editors are either silent, or even lie a
little, in seasons of financial and commercial depression. But
it is also true that in our present circumstances there are unpleasant
things which admit of mitigation, and even of radical
cure; and it is perhaps wiser to state what most of us know
and suggest the remedies for an evil case.</p>

<p>It is known that the wages of laboring men and clerks all
over the country are being cut down. It is probably within
the mark to say that seven millions of wage-earners (of all
classes) will receive in 1885 an average of ten per cent. less
compensation for their services than they received in 1884. Assuming
a very low average for the old wages, $1.25 per day, the
total reduction in wages for the year will amount to more than
$260,000,000. This amount will of course be taken from the
net total of trade. The workmen and clerks will buy two
hundred and sixty million dollars worth less of goods in 1885.
The reduction will be dispersed over a large area, but it will
not spread into a thinness which will render it impalpable.
Nor does the reduction end with the workmen. All the persons
of whom workmen buy manufactured goods will buy less
for their own consumption—they also will have less to buy
with. This class is a very large one, and there are few of us
who do not belong in it—are not in some way dependent on
workmen for patronage. To say that all these will reduce their
annual purchases two hundred and sixty millions, carrying the
reduction up to five hundred and twenty millions, is probably
within the mark. We may as well consider in this connection the
reductions in the price of farm products, another great drain on
the volume of trade. Agricultural products are worth at most
ten per cent. less than in 1883. The effect of the reduction
in prices of farm products acts more disastrously on trade, since
farmers usually double their caution. They will not merely
buy ten per cent. less; they will buy as little as possible. Old
clothes, old wagons, old tools, will be kept in use, and it may
be within the mark to say that the loss of farmers’ trade of all
sorts will amount to as much as all the others—to five hundred
and twenty millions more. One thousand and forty millions
taken off from the <i>net</i> total of sales of goods will necessarily
be keenly missed. The payment of all the national debt in a
prosperous year would be easier and more pleasant. If it had
no compensations this reduction would crush the life out of us.
At least it is a burden to bear. Economies upon customary
spending in a single household matter but little, but economies
in millions of households—less buying of customary comforts—are
a large matter. They are not merely a consequence of
hard times; they make the times hard. And we are so bound together
that the enforced economies in the families of workmen
act on the whole purchasing line with mathematical certainty.
It is a good thing, a beneficence of natural order, that there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
compensations. We see these natural offsets most easily by looking
back at the case of the farmer. He has to sell his food in a
cheaper market, and wants to buy also in a cheaper market. He
has made food cheaper for the workman, and he wants the goods
made by the workman at less cost. He wants the same amount
of cloth, sugar, salt, tools, etc., for the same number of bushels
of wheat. It is the cloth, tools, etc., that he wants as a farmer.
As a debtor, indeed, he wants the same number of dollars;
and this is <i>his</i> real pinch. He is in debt, and has to pay
in the fall of grain a twenty per cent. premium on what he
owes. As a producer, he would, however, suffer no harm if all
other prices fell as much as the price of grain. If, then, by the
corresponding and simultaneous reduction of the price of food
and of wages, the ten per cent. less money would buy the same
things to eat and wear—if the reduction were equalized all
round—nobody would suffer. The farmer’s grain would buy
as much as before; the workman’s wages would buy as much.
Goods of all kinds would be so much cheaper in money terms,
but just as valuable in barter terms. The reduction would be
only in the figures and not in the facts of trade. The footings
of the ledgers would be smaller, but the ledgers of comfort
would show an undiminished balance in favor of happiness.</p>

<p>Will it work out in this way? Partly it will; partly it will
not. Cheaper food will partly balance the accounts of all parties,
but some accounts will not balance. Prices sink or rise
unequally. And this is not half our trouble. In these matters
“thinking makes it so;” the belief that we are losing ground
causes the sliding back which we dread. There is a reluctance
to buy what we are accustomed to buy. The reduction in
wages makes men <i>feel</i> poor; and to feel poor is to be a poor
customer of the seller. Suppose that a general fall in prices is
going on—a possibly complete explanation of our troubles—then
we must remember that all values are disturbed. We can
not make a “horizontal reduction” by a stroke of the pen. It
must be effected slowly and painfully and irregularly and in
detail. The results are suffering and depression of spirit. The
strain is severe, but it has to be borne; and patience really
lightens all burdens. If we reflect that these stretches of bare
ground in trade are really safe roads—safer than the smoother
paths along which we have driven gaily and recklessly—we
shall have confidence to keep company with patience, and the
two will make a rough road tolerable, if not enjoyable. Honest
and industrious souls thrive in such times. Speculative
rogues thrive in good times. The honest man’s chief trouble
is that he <i>will</i> get into debt. His worst calamity is he is paying
now with eighty-cent wheat debts contracted in dollar-wheat
prices. The poor man can not be helped. May the Lord be
good to him.</p>

<p>“But” one will say, “this is not our whole disease. We are
really at war. Workmen are falling under the wheels of a
great machine called progress; and the machine is driven by
forces too powerful for any hope of resistance. It is not a mere
readjustment of prices; it is a life and death struggle; and the
god Competition must be dethroned, or the people will perish.”
We do not believe this wild-eyed reformer, but we do expect a
hard winter. Let us all remember the poor.</p>

<p>The steady growth of this country is shown by the fact that

About this time it is interesting to learn that there are only

<p>Hostile Apaches continue to be troublesome on the Mexican
border. They escape across the line and are safe from pursuit.
These troubles will end when the two governments make
permanent arrangements for the pursuit of marauders across

but it should be permanent—unless, indeed, our citizens
fear Mexican soldiers more than they fear Indians.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A United States Court has decided in due form that an

<p>A Connecticut paper soberly declares that a citizen of that
state did not know the name of either candidate for the presidency
until the Saturday before the election. And yet people
unreasonably complain that there was too much noise in the
late campaign.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is remarked that Presidential electors were scratched to a
considerable extent this year. It is as unreasonable a performance
as kicking the stone you have stumbled over, more
so indeed for the stone has done you some harm, while a Presidential
elector is incapable of doing any harm. He is, by our
political customs, merely a machine for transmitting a vote to
the candidate of the party. But there has been so much of
this scratching this year that politicians will probably estimate
its influence hereafter. In a close election this species of
scratcher might defeat his own wishes and his party by blind
stupidity.</p>

<p>A new life of the witty Sydney Smith has brought to light a
new piece of his inimitable jesting. A friend complained to
Smith that in an important interview Lord Brougham had

said the incorrigible wit, in his most sympathetic tones, “never
mind, never mind, <i>he thought you knew it</i>.”</p>

<p>“Swift as the wind” is not very swift after all. The record
of its travels in New York City, for a whole week in
November, showed only 1,076 miles. Ocean steamers go
nearly three times as fast, and through trains from New York
to Chicago travel five times as fast. A good pedestrian would
beat an average wind if he did not have to rest.</p>

<p>Since the November election there has been a marked increase
in business failures. The wages of workmen have been
reduced in many places, and many mills have suspended.
Politicians are not agreed about the cause, but it is probable
that this will be a hard winter for the poor. Heavenly charity
will, we trust, be everywhere equal to the tasks laid upon
her. Remember the poor.</p>

<p>It is positively affirmed that physicians regard canned foods
as dangerous. Many cases of poisoning occur from eating
such foods, but chemical testimony is divided. Some chemists
trace the poisoning to special conditions of the food used; in
other words, the food was in an advanced state of decomposition
when it was put into the can. This is the opinion recently
expressed by an eminent English chemist. In this
view, proper caution in examining the food will avert all
danger.</p>

<p>What impressions would our chief cities make on those of us
who do not live in them, if we received all our knowledge of
them through the newsy papers? San Francisco, for example,
is known in that way as the home of Sand Lot orators, astonishing
divorce suits, fighting editors, and swearing preachers.
The latest of these picturesque incidents is the shooting
of an editor, Mr. De Young, who is the second man in his
family to be shot by outraged and bloody-minded readers.
Such incidents doubtless misrepresent the City of the Golden
Gate; but many thousands of newspaper readers know only
these miserable doings in San Francisco.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most unfortunate man in the late campaign was

<p>The “roller-skating rink” is condemned in vigorous terms

<p>The outbreak of cholera in Paris has created almost a panic,

its reception in this country next summer; though it could be
kept out by proper and sufficient quarantine measures.</p>

Authority is of some importance in this case, and whatever

<p>The last of the patents for sewing machines expired in 1876;
but the women of the country are so attached to the old machines
that they would not buy the new, and probably better
machines. The result is that the new companies go into
bankruptcy and the old companies monopolize the business.
Here is a plain account of one of the “grasping monopolies”
of the country. A few others are explained by the insane attachment
of the men of the country to tools of a particular
brand or make.</p>

<p>We notice in the papers an unusual number of reports of
contests over wills containing charitable bequests. Let us say
frankly that we think this post mortem method of being charitable
rather a sneaking way of discharging the duty of benevolence.
Give like a man what you might keep yourself. It is
a coward’s way to assess your children to pay your debts to
philanthropy. A man who really wants to be benevolent is
usually able to execute his own will. Be your own executor.</p>

<p>The largest farm in America has been sold to foreign nabobs.
It is a cattle ranch of 800,000 acres in Texas. Mr. King, who
has just sold it for $6,500,000, built up this property, beginning
with nothing. He is now eighty years old and thinks it time
to retire from business. The new owners will operate the farm
as a joint stock concern, and it will probably be bankrupt in
twenty years. One King is better than a score of nabobs for
such business.</p>

<p>The English House of Lords has obtained a great victory.
After a summer of agitation in the form of great meetings,
monster processions and burning eloquence, the Ministry has
compromised with the Lords on the Franchise bill, on terms
dictated by the Lords. The Radicals are very angry; but Mr.
Gladstone has secured the extension of the ballot to some millions
of Englishmen, and is believed to regard this success as
a fitting crown of his public career. He will leave the “reform

<p>The immigration of ten months of this year brought us
414,000 new citizens; in the same period last year 501,000

<p>A French chemist has thought of a useful device to prevent
accidents in the handling of poisons. A large number of persons
are killed every year by mistakes of apothecaries, of their
friends, or of themselves. The French chemist suggests that
white cylindrical bottles be used for medicines to be taken internally,
and colored square bottles for medicines to be used
externally. The suggestion can be improved by additional
devices to prevent mistakes, but half the errors would be cut
off by the proposed plan.</p>

regulating the American family. If polygamy becomes a state
institution, it will be as strongly entrenched as slavery was;
and it may be held that a plural marriage in one state is good
in all the states; this is the rule for monogamous marriage.</p>

has taken this step. He is a man of broad views and generous
impulses, and useful in a high institution of learning. It is
not too much to say that he is better known at the North
than any educator in the South. His sermons and lectures
in Northern States have awakened new sympathies in the
hearts of many people for the cause of higher education in the
South, and indeed, Dr. Haygood has been one of the best representatives
of the South. Always standing firmly by his college
and people, he has done much to strengthen the bonds of union
between the two sections. Perhaps his new office will give him
a new range on more people, and increase his opportunities
for usefulness. It is not the privilege of many men to decline
the offices of bishop and the presidency of a college such as
that at Macon inside three years, but Dr. Haygood has done
both of these things. We predict for him large success in his
new educational work.</p>

<p>It is refreshing to find that the Christmas idea of making
others happy has at last reached our Sunday-schools. For
years teachers and parents have made annually an exhaustive
effort to feast their schools on Christmas day. However great
their efforts the results could never be entirely satisfactory.
Somebody was unavoidably overlooked, and the managers
were always too nearly worn out to enjoy the holiday. A new
plan, we hope, is to be instituted. Last season many schools
tried it, more are making the experiment this year. It is to substitute
giving by the school. On Christmas eve the classes
bring in offerings for the poor. Whatever they wish and their
purses allow is offered. The plan meets with the heartiest reception
wherever proposed, the smallest children often being
the most eager to give. A general adoption of this method of
celebrating Christmas would do much to counteract the selfish
feeling so often found in Sunday-schools that gifts, entertainments
and prizes must be continually given in order to keep
the school together.</p>

man in our faculty. Mr. Hale’s position in the religious and
literary world is well established. Last spring when <i>The

the forty native American authors whom it deemed most
worthy to form the “forty immortals” of a proposed American
Academy, his name was the eleventh on the list, which ran:
Holmes, Lowell, Whittier, Bancroft, Howells, Curtis, Aldrich,
Harte, Stedman, White and Hale. His books are known
most widely; his sympathies are broad and wise; he is a man of
the truest culture of both mind and heart. He will be welcomed

the great summer school, was for several years president of
Washington and Jefferson College, and since his connection
with that institution ceased he has been the pastor of a Presbyterian
church in Denver, Col. His name has several times
appeared on the Chautauqua programs, and his appearance
on that platform has always been very welcome. Dr. Hays
will represent the C. L. S. C. in the West, and we look for large
results from his efforts. This new department of church work
will be a great addition to the Chautauqua attractions for 1885.</p>

<h3>COLLEGE GREEK COURSE IN ENGLISH.</h3>

<p>P. 16.—“Herodotus.” Critical essays containing the results of the
researches concerning Herodotus will be found in the works of the eminent
Germans, Creuzer, Dahlman, Heyse, Blum, A. Bauer, K. O.
Müller, Stein, Kirchhoff and Blakesley. De Quincey has an essay in
Vol. i. of “Historical and Critical Essays.” See also Vol. ii. of “A
History of Classical Greek Literature,” by J. P. Mahaffy.</p>

<p>The following abridged opinions on Herodotus are interesting. Macaulay
says of him: Of the romantic historians, Herodotus is the earliest
and the best. His animation, his simple-hearted tenderness, his
wonderful talent for description and dialogue, and the pure, sweet flow
of his language place him at the head of narrators. He reminds us of
a delightful child.… But he has not written a good history.…
The faults of Herodotus are the faults of a simple and imaginative mind.
He wrote as it was natural he should write. He wrote for a nation
susceptible, curious, lively, insatiably desirous of novelty and excitement;
for a nation in which the fine arts had attained their highest excellence,
but in which philosophy was still in its infancy. Mahaffy
quotes the German Blakesley’s opinion that Herodotus wrote not to instruct
but to <i>please</i>, that he selected such events and attributed such
motives as he thought would be striking and popular, without any misgivings
as to the accuracy of statement; that at his time there was
no historic sense, but that the idea of exact and critical historical writing
is a late and gradual acquisition which Thucydides acquired only
by his extraordinary genius and circumstances in those early days.</p>

<p>P. 21.—“Rawlinson,” The Rev. George. (1815-⸺.) An Oxford
man, in 1874 made Canon of Canterbury. Besides his “Herodotus” he
has published a celebrated work called “The Five Great Monarchies of
the Ancient Eastern World, or the History, Geography and Antiquities
of Chaldea, Assyria, Babylonia, Media and Persia.” To this he
added, in 1873, the “Sixth Great Oriental Monarchy,” meaning Parthia,
and in 1876 the “Seventh Great Oriental Monarchy; or the
Geography, History and Antiquity of the Sassanian or New Persian
Empire.”</p>

<p>“Rawlinson,” Sir Henry. (1810-⸺.) A brother of the former.
When but sixteen years of age he was sent to the East in the service of
the East India Company; being transferred to the Persian army, he began
to study the Persian cuneiform inscriptions and forwarded valuable
copies to England. He also explored the countries of Central Asia.
His studies have given him high rank among modern archæologists.
His publications include several valuable works on the history and inscriptions
of Assyria, Babylon and Chaldea, and he has contributed many
learned papers to the journals of the Asiatic Society.</p>

<p>“Wilkinson.” (1797-1875.) An Englishman who during a residence
of twelve years in Egypt studied the history, ruins, manners and customs
of the country. His studies were embodied in voluminous works
on a great variety of phases of Egyptian life and history, including the
“Topography of Thebes and General View of Egypt,” “Manners and
Customs of the Ancient Egyptians,” “Architecture of Ancient Egypt,”
“Modern Egypt and Thebes,” and others. In striking contrast was a
subject on which he published a work in 1858—“Color, and the General
Diffusion of Taste among all Classes.”</p>

<p>P. 22.—“Lydian Empire.” Lydia was a very early seat of Asiatic
civilization, the empire being founded at Sardis in mythical times.
Three dynasties of kings are said to have ruled the country, the Atyadæ,
the Heraclidæ and the Mermnadæ, the last of which alone is authentic.
Of their civilization Smith says: “Among the inventions or improvements
which the Greeks are said to have derived from them were the
weaving and dyeing of fine fabrics; various processes of metallurgy;
the use of gold and silver money, which the Lydians are said to have
first coined; and various metrical and musical improvements, especially
the scale or mode of music called the Lydian, and the form of lyre called
the Magadis.” After the Persian conquest of Lydia it formed with
Mysia, the second satrapy. After the Macedonian conquest it passed to
the kings of Syria, thence to those of Pergamus, and finally to the Romans,
who made it a part of the province of Asia.</p>

<p>“Sardis,” or Sardes, stood until the wars of the Middle Ages, when
in 1402 it was almost entirely destroyed by Tamerlane. The remains
extend over a wide space. Two Ionic columns (see illustration, page
33, of “College Greek Course,”) are the most conspicuous of the remains.
These columns are supposed to have belonged to a temple of
Cybele. The walls of the Acropolis, some of its towers, a few remnants
of the magnificent palace of Crœsus, of a gymnasium, and a few other
buildings are all that can be traced. The tombs of the Lydian kings
are in the neighborhood, prominent among which is the tumulus of
Alyattes, a huge circular mound 1,140 feet in diameter. An Arabian
village of mud huts called Sart now stands on its site.</p>

<p>P. 26.—“Crœsus’s father.” Alyattes, king of Lydia, B. C. 617-560.</p>

<p>P. 27.—“Hermus.” A good sized river of Asia Minor, rising in
Phrygia, flowing through Lydia, watering the plain of Sardis, and emptying
into the Gulf of Smyrna.</p>

<p>P. 28.—“Telmessus.” A town of Cana about six miles from Halicarnassus.
Its people were celebrated for their power in divination.</p>

<p>P. 32.—“Agbatana.” The usual form of writing the word is Ecbatana;
the first form is the Ionic, used in poetry.</p>

<p>“Pactyas.” An army was sent against this man when he fled to
Cyme, thence to Mytilene, and from there to Chios. The Chians gave
him up to the Persians.</p>

<p>P. 33.—“L’Allegro,” läl-lāˈgrō. The merry, the gay.</p>

<p>P. 35.—“Nitocris.” Supposed to have been the wife of Nebuchadnezzar,
and the mother or grandmother of Belshazzar. While queen of Babylon
many important works were carried on by her for the improvement
of the city.</p>

<p>P. 37.—“Massagetæ.” They were probably a nomad people of Central
Asia. The best authorities suppose them to have lived north of the
Jaxartes and the sea of Aral. Some critics identify them with the
Mesech of the Scriptures. Many of their customs were very peculiar.
They worshipped the sun, to which they sacrificed horses. Their very
old people were killed and eaten. The race to which they belonged is
in dispute, though usually considered the Turkoman.</p>

<p>P. 40.—“Prexaspes.” He had always been held in high honor by
Cambyses, having been employed by the latter to kill his brother Smerdis,
whom he feared. Later in life an impostor calling himself Smerdis,
tried to usurp the throne and Cambyses suspected Prexaspes, but he
cleared himself. After the death of Cambyses this false Smerdis was
acknowledged king, and the Magi, who had put him on the throne, tried
to win over Prexaspes to their plans, but he told before the assembled
Persians of the assassination of the true Smerdis, and then threw himself
from the tower on which he was standing.</p>

<p>P. 43.—“Apis.” A bull worshipped by the Egyptians. He was supposed
to contain the spirit of the divinity Osiris, and was the symbol of
fertility. The god must be black, with a white square or triangular
mark on his forehead, an eagle on the back, and other mysterious marks
about the body. When such an animal was found he was carried to
Heliopolis and thence to Memphis, where he had his own temple and
priests. The lifetime of Apis was twenty-five years. If one died the
whole land was in mourning until a successor was found.</p>

<p>P. 45.—“Staters,” stāˈter. The chief gold coin of the Greeks,
usually worth about $5.50, though it varied much in value.</p>

<p>P. 51.—“Andrians.” The inhabitants of Andros, the most northerly
of the Cyclades.</p>

<p>“Ca-rysˈti-ans.” Those of Carystus, a town on the southern coast of
Eubœa. Beautiful white marble and the mineral asbestos abounded
near Carystus.</p>

<p>“Parians.” From Paros, one of the largest of the Cyclades, north of
Delos.</p>

<p>P. 52.—“Thucydides.” For additional readings on Thucydides see
Grote’s History of Greece, and also Thirwall’s, Mahaffy’s History of
Classical Greek Literature, Müller and Donaldson’s History of Greek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Literature, and Mure’s History of the Greek Language and Literature.</p>

<p>Cicero commends Thucydides as “a faithful and dignified narrator of
facts,” and declares that he surpasses all others in the art of composition.</p>

<p>Macaulay says: “Thucydides has surpassed all his rivals in the art
of historical narration, in the art of producing an effect on the imagination
by skilful selection and disposition without indulging in the license
of invention.”</p>

<p>Mahaffy thus compares Herodotus and Thucydides: “While the conceptions
of history in Herodotus and Thucydides were mainly the consequence
of the temper of the men and of their surroundings, it must be
declared that, <i>for an historian</i>, the atmosphere in which the latter lived,
while giving him critical acumen and freeing him from theological
prejudices narrowed his view and distorted his estimate of the relative
importance of events. We may indeed feel very grateful that Herodotus
was not attracted in early life by this brilliant exclusiveness, and
that he remained an Ionic instead of becoming an Attic historian.”</p>

<p>P. 56.—“Jowett,” jowˈet. (1817-⸺.) An English Greek scholar
and professor.</p>

<p>P. 72.—“Peabody.” (1811-⸺.) An American theologian and
author.</p>

<p>P. 73.—“Eurymedon.” One of the Athenian generals in the Peloponnesian
war. After the expedition to Corcyra, Eurymedon commanded
in the expedition against Sicily in 425. In 414 he was a
leader in a second armament fitted out against Syracuse; he fell in the
first sea fight in the harbor of that city.</p>

<p>P. 81.—“Alcæus.” About B. C. 600. A native of Mytilene. In a
war between Athens and his country he is said to have fled, leaving his
arms on the field of battle. He was afterward driven from his native
land in a strife between the nobility and people, and spent the remainder
of his life traveling. Some of his odes are extant, and the imitations
of Horace have made the character of Alcæus’ verse well known.
See “Brief History of Greece,” page 52. Mahaffy says of Alcæus, we
see in him “the perfect picture of an unprincipled, violent, lawless
Greek aristocrat, who sacrificed all and everything to the demands of
pleasure and power.”</p>

<h3>THE CHARACTER OF JESUS.</h3>

<p>Excellent works to read in connection with “The Character of
Jesus” are Farrar’s “Life of Christ,” Thomas Hughes’s “Manliness of
Christ,” Geikie’s “Life and Words of Christ,” Pollock’s “The Christ
of Christianity and of Modern Criticism.”</p>

<p>P. 108.—“Celsus.” An Epicurean philosopher who lived in the second
century. Only fragments of his works have been preserved as
quotations given by Origen. He charges Christians with blind credulity,
with religious arrogance, with party divisions, and with having altered
their sacred writings. His own doctrines were that evil is necessary
and eternal, and that sin can never be entirely removed, least of
all by vicarious sacrifice.</p>

<p>P. 109.—“Justin Martyr.” The earliest of the church fathers after
the apostolic age. He lived in the second century, and attended the
pagan schools of Asia Minor, Greece and Egypt. Afterward he embraced
the Christian religion and wrote two apologies in its behalf.
He suffered martyrdom at Rome under Marcus Aurelius, because he
refused to sacrifice to the heathen gods.</p>

<p>“Tertullian.” An eminent Latin father of the church who lived at
Carthage in the second century. He was converted from paganism to
Christianity. He was a man of powerful intellect and great learning;
was the author of numerous works which are still extant.</p>

<p>P. 111.—“Summum bonum.” A Latin expression meaning the
highest good.</p>

<p>P. 134.—“Talmud.” The work which gives the laws, both civil
and canonical, of the Jews. It contains the rules by which the conduct
of the people is regulated, and relates not only to religion, but also to
philosophy, medicine, history, and the branches of practical duty.</p>

<p>P. 136.—“Mr. Parker,” Theodore. (1810-1860.) A distinguished
American scholar; a Unitarian minister. His new doctrines gave great
offence to the New England Unitarians, as he assumed the absolute humanity
of Christ, and said his inspiration differed in no respect from
that of other men. He died in Florence, whither he had gone for his
health.</p>

<p>P. 161.—“Vishnu.” One of the gods of the Hindoos, a sun god.
He gave the earth to man as his inheritance. The unbroken order of
the world is due to him.</p>

<h3>TEMPERANCE TEACHINGS OF SCIENCE.</h3>

<p id="temperance1"><a href="#anch_temperance1">1.</a> “Abd el Wahab.” The founder of a recent Mohammedan sect
now dominant throughout the greater part of Arabia. He was the son of
an Arab chief, and was born about the end of the seventeenth century. He
was highly educated, and conceived the idea of restoring in its primitive
shape the ruined structure of Islam. The Koran had fallen into
abeyance, and their religion was little else than a round of external ceremonies.
He gained a numerous following in his efforts to revive the
old zeal in their religion. The sect took the name of the Wa-haˈbis, or
the Wa-haˈbites.</p>

<p id="temperance2"><a href="#anch_temperance2">2.</a> “The earthquake at Lisbon.” This, the greatest of the frequent
earthquakes at Lisbon, and one of the most remarkable that ever occurred
anywhere, took place in 1775, and destroyed a great part of the
city. The area affected was very extensive. The shock was felt on one
side as far as the southern shore of Finland, and on the other it reached
to Canada, an area of 7,500,000 square miles. The force required to
move this must have been enormous, for suppose the thickness of the
earth’s crust moved to have been only twenty miles, then 150,000,000
cubic miles of solid matter was moved. The sea wave caused by it rose
to a height of sixty feet at Cadiz.</p>

<p id="temperance3"><a href="#anch_temperance3">3.</a> “Laputa.” The name of a flying island described by Swift in his
imaginary “Travels of Lemuel Gulliver.” It is said to be “exactly
circular, its diameter seven thousand eight hundred and thirty-seven
yards, or about four miles and a half, and consequently contains ten
thousand acres.” The inhabitants are speculative philosophers, devoted
to mathematics and music.—<i>Webster’s Dictionary.</i></p>

<p>So materializing is the spirit of the age that the extended study of
physical and mechanical science seems likely one of these days to
convert our island (Great Britain) into a <i>Laputa</i>.—<i>Keightly.</i></p>

<p id="temperance4"><a href="#anch_temperance4">4.</a> “Syrian Maronites,” marˈo-nites. A Christian tribe of very ancient
origin. In the year 1445 they were formally united to the Roman
Catholic Church, but were allowed to retain their own national rites and
usages. Their priests are allowed to marry.</p>

<p id="temperance5"><a href="#anch_temperance5">5.</a> “Lazaretto.” A pest-house or hospital for the reception of the
sick, particularly for those affected with contagious distempers.</p>

<p id="temperance6"><a href="#anch_temperance6">6.</a> “Bactrian nomads.” Bactria is a country of Central Asia. A
great part of it is made up of stretches of barren and drifting sands, so
that the inhabitants are obliged to resort to the nomadic style of life.
It was subjugated by Alexander the Great, but afterward became independent.
Its modern history is not important.</p>

<p id="temperance7"><a href="#anch_temperance7">7.</a> “Titus Oates.” An Englishman who in the reign of Charles II.
communicated the details of a pretended plot, “the figment of his own
brain,” in which were revealed a rising of the Catholic party, a general
massacre of the Protestants, the burning of London, and the assassination
of the king. Several incidents seemed to corroborate the monstrous
assertion, and it was universally believed. All London went wild with
fear and rage, and at one time a massacre of the Roman Catholics
seemed likely to occur in anticipation of the one the Protestants feared.
Many of the Catholics were arrested, tried and condemned to meet the
death of traitors at the block. On the accession of James II., Oates
was tried, sentenced to be pilloried, publicly whipped, and afterward
imprisoned for life. When William III. came to the throne he was
pardoned, and was no more heard of. He died in obscurity seventeen
years later, in 1705, at the age of seventy-six.</p>

<p id="temperance8"><a href="#anch_temperance8">8.</a> “Jack Sheppard.” (1701-1724.) He was noted for twice escaping
from prison at Newgate, whither he was sent for taking part in the
revolution against the king, George I. He was hung at Tyburn.</p>

<p id="temperance9"><a href="#anch_temperance9">9.</a> “Absinthe.”—A cordial of brandy flavored with wormwood.</p>

<h3>SUNDAY READINGS.</h3>

<p id="sunday1"><a href="#anch_sunday1">1.</a> “St. Augustine.” (354-430.) One of the fathers of the Christian
church. He was born at Tagaste, in Africa. He was sent to Carthage
to be educated, and there plunged into the frightful abyss of corruptions
which marked that wicked city. In his “Confessions” he describes
his life at this time, and does not seek to excuse himself. At the age of
thirty-three years he embraced the Christian religion and was baptized
by Ambrose. His conversion from his errors was complete and permanent.
Monica, his mother, who through all these years had been praying
for her son, died shortly after, feeling that she could depart in peace,
as her eyes had seen his salvation. He wrote with great zeal and voluminously
against all the sects which the church held to be heretical.</p>

<p id="sunday2"><a href="#anch_sunday2">2.</a> “Bourdaloue,” Louis. (1632-1704.) A most eloquent French
preacher. Louis XIV. was an attendant upon his ministry, and on
many different occasions invited him to preach the festival sermons before
the court of Versailles. He was renowned for the solid dignity of
his thought and his fervid religious eloquence.</p>

“It was built on a high terrace of the Cyrenæan table-land,
about nine miles from the coast of Appolonia, which became its port.
The road which connected the city with the harbor, a vast necropolis,
and ruins of streets, temples, theaters, tombs, and remnants of art, are

modern Grennah.”</p>

<p id="greeklife7"><a href="#anch_greeklife7">7.</a> “Æginetan,” æg-i-neˈtan. Pertaining to the island and city of
Ægina.</p>

of our jurymen, rather than of the judges of courts.</p>

<p id="greeklife9"><a href="#anch_greeklife9">9.</a> “Arˈte-mon.” Said to have been from Clazomenæ. He was an
engineer, and to him was attributed the invention of the testudo and the
battering ram. In the siege of Samos he was employed by Pericles.</p>

home was Thasos, but who afterward became a citizen of Athens, where
he was employed by Cimon to ornament the temple of Theseus. “He
is styled ‘The Homer of painting,’ because he treated his subjects in an
epic rather than a dramatic spirit. He had imagination in the highest
degree. In allusion to the ideal character and moral expression of his
works, Aristotle calls him an <i>ethic</i> painter. The same critic says, in another
passage, ‘Polygnotus represented men better than they are (superior
to nature).’ Among his works were the ‘Capture of Troy,’ and the
‘Visit of Ulysses to the Lower World.’”</p>

<p id="greeklife13"><a href="#anch_greeklife13">13.</a> “Ma-chaˈon Pod-a-lirˈi-us.” A son of Æsculapius, celebrated

<h3>GREEK MYTHOLOGY.</h3>

<p>Those desiring to carry on more fully their readings in Greek Mythology
will find the following works peculiarly helpful: “Mythology of the
Aryan Nations,” G. W. Cox; “Introduction to the Science of Religion,”
Max Müller; “Origin and Development of Religious Belief,” Baring-Gould;
“Handbook of Mythology,” G. W. Cox; “Myth and Science,”
Vignole; “Mythology,” Seeman.</p>

<p id="greekmyth1"><a href="#anch_greekmyth1">1.</a> “Hestia.” The Greek form corresponding to the Latin Vesta.
It is conjectured by some that the two words are the same, going back
to a period when the Greeks and Latins were still an undivided people.</p>

<p id="greekmyth2"><a href="#anch_greekmyth2">2.</a> “Pe-nāˈtēs.” The word is derived from <i>penus</i>, the innermost part
of the house, and referred to those divinities who, as exercising providential
care over domestic affairs, were considered as the gods of the
household. The Penates were also the gods of the state, considered as
a family, and as such had a sanctuary near the center of Rome, where
sacrifices were made by public men.</p>

<p id="greekmyth3"><a href="#anch_greekmyth3">3.</a> “Tutelary,” tūˈte-la-ry. Derived from the Latin word <i>tutela</i>,
protection, and signifying protecting goddess.</p>

stood in Rome, in the Forum, and over the temple presided four, afterward
six, virgins, who were chosen to the office at first by the kings, and
later by lot. They entered on this service when no older than ten years,
and served thirty years; the first ten being spent in learning, the second
ten in performing, and the third in teaching, their duties. A vow of
chastity was taken, the violation of which was punished by being buried
alive. The chief duty of the virgins was to keep the fire on the altar of
the goddess ever burning. After the term had expired they might marry,
although it was considered unlucky.</p>

<p id="greekmyth5"><a href="#anch_greekmyth5">5.</a> “Cyl-leˈne.” The highest mountain in Peloponnesus. It was
sacred to Mercury, who was said to have been born there, and was

disappear underground. The Alpheus rises again at Pegæ, and flows
northwest into the Ionian Sea.</p>

regions. He was a son of Typhon and Echidna, and is represented
as a dog with three heads, the tail of a serpent, and a mane composed
of the anterior extremities of numberless snakes. His business
was to admit the spirits of the dead into their subterranean abode, and
to prevent them from leaving it. Orpheus lulled him to sleep with his
lyre, and Hercules dragged him from Hades, and exhibited him to the
eyes of wondering mortals.”</p>

<p id="greekmyth12"><a href="#anch_greekmyth12">12.</a> “Terˈra in-cog-niˈta.” Unknown land.</p>

<p id="greekmyth13"><a href="#anch_greekmyth13">13.</a> “Judges.” Miˈnos, and Rhadˌa-manˈthus were brothers, sons

disseminate information relating to fruit growing, and to promote a cordial
spirit of intercourse among horticulturists. It has brought together
from all the states and territories the most intelligent, experienced and
skilful cultivators who have taught each other and made the knowledge
of one the property of all. Its sessions are held in the different leading
cities of the country.</p>

<p id="kitchen6"><a href="#anch_kitchen6">6.</a> “Pruˈnus Perˈsi-ca.” The Prunus is a genus of trees of the order
Rosaceæ, including those species which have the stone of the fruit

<h3>CHEMISTRY.</h3>

<p id="chemistry1"><a href="#anch_chemistry1">1.</a> “Galileo,” găl-i-leeˈo. (1564-1642.) An illustrious astronomer,
mathematician and philosopher, the creator of experimental science.
He made a number of important discoveries in the science of astronomy,
among which were Jupiter’s satellites, Saturn’s rings, the sun’s
spots, and the starry nature of the milky way. He was a strong advocate
of the Copernican system—which represents the sun to be at rest
in the center and the earth and other planets to move round it—and for
this was twice persecuted by the Inquisition. On both occasions he
was publicly compelled to abjure the system, but the last time he is said
to have stamped his foot while muttering to himself, “but nevertheless
it does move.” The later years of his life were spent in his country
house near Florence.</p>

<p id="chemistry2"><a href="#anch_chemistry2">2.</a> “Torricelli,” tor-ri-celˈli. (1608-1647.) A celebrated Italian
mathematician and philosopher. He made himself renowned for all
time by his interpretation of the fact that water will rise in a suction
pump to a height of thirty-two feet, which, up to his time, had been explained
on the ground that “nature abhors a vacuum;” above that
limit the law was modified. Torricelli employed mercury to perform
this experiment, and soon found the clue to the mystery. He discovered
that the column of fluid was sustained by the pressure of the atmosphere
on the open surface of the fluid.</p>

<p id="chemistry3"><a href="#anch_chemistry3">3.</a> “Blaise Pascal.” (1623-1662) A distinguished French philosopher
and scholar. In his sixteenth year he produced a treaty on conic
sections; in his nineteenth year he invented a calculating machine.
Turning his attention to the theory of fluids which Torricelli had advanced,
he wrote two essays which established his reputation as an experimental
physicist. He was the author of the magnificent but unfinished
“Pensées.” He was of a deeply religious turn, and before his
death was entirely given up to prayer and practices of mortification,
among which may be mentioned that of wearing an iron girdle studded
with sharp points which he forced into his flesh whenever he felt himself
assailed by sinful thoughts. “Puy de Dome,” pwī deh dōm.</p>

<p id="chemistry4"><a href="#anch_chemistry4">4.</a> “Tarpeia,” tar-peˈya. The daughter of Tarpeius, the governor of
the citadel of Rome. She promised to open the gates of the city to the
Sabines if they would give her what they carried on their left hands,
meaning their gold bracelets. The king consented, and as he entered
the gates, to punish her perfidy he threw not only his bracelet, but his
shield upon her. His soldiers followed his example, and she was
crushed to death. She was buried in the capitol, which from her has
been called the Tarpeian Rock.</p>

<p id="chemistry5"><a href="#anch_chemistry5">5.</a> “Haliotis,” hal-i-ōˈtis. A genus of gasteropods with a shell resembling
the human ear. The gasteropods are a class of univalve mollusks,
like the snail.</p>

<p id="chemistry6"><a href="#anch_chemistry6">6.</a> “Skate.” A kind of shark. A name given to several species of
fish having a rhomboidal body.</p>

<p id="chemistry7"><a href="#anch_chemistry7">7.</a> “Magdeburg Hemispheres.” They are two hollow hemispheres
generally made of brass or copper, with edges accurately fitted to each
other, and one of them provided with a stop cock. When the edges are
pressed tightly together and the globe thus formed is exhausted of air
through the cock, the hemispheres are held together with such force
that it is with great difficulty they can be pulled apart.</p>

<p id="chemistry8"><a href="#anch_chemistry8">8.</a> “Otto von Güricke,” fon gāˈrik-eh. (1602-1686.) A celebrated
German physicist. He invented the air-pump and made the famous experiment
with the Magdeburg hemispheres.</p>

<p id="chemistry9"><a href="#anch_chemistry9">9.</a> “Tower of Pisa.” The round marble belfry called “The Leaning
Tower” because it deviates about fourteen feet from the perpendicular.
It is 180 feet high, and consists of seven stories divided by rows
of columns, and surmounted by a flat roof and an open gallery commanding
a splendid view of the surrounding country. It was built in
the twelfth century by a German architect, Wilhelm of Innsbruck.</p>

<p id="chemistry10"><a href="#anch_chemistry10">10.</a> “Mariotte,” Mä-ri-ŏtˈ. A French philosopher of the seventeenth
century. He possessed an extraordinary power of drawing conclusions
from experiment. He made a thorough investigation of the
subject of the conduction of water, and calculated the strength necessary
for pipes under different circumstances.</p>

<p id="chemistry11"><a href="#anch_chemistry11">11.</a> “Air-gun.” An instrument resembling a musket. By means of
a condenser the air is forced into a metallic globe which is attached to
the musket nearly opposite the trigger.</p>

<p id="chemistry12"><a href="#anch_chemistry12">12.</a> “Torricellian Vacuum.” To produce this vacuum a small quantity
of pure mercury is placed in the tube and boiled for some time. It
is then allowed to cool and a further quantity, previously warmed, added,
which is boiled, and so on until the tube is quite full; in this manner

<p>Pass, certificate, and competitive examinations are, no doubt,
all sufficiently serious affairs to examinees, and sufficiently trying
ones to examiners. To the outer public, however, to those
“who have no son or brother there,” such “exams.” are, as a
rule, nothing if not a source of amusement. The “results”
aimed at in examinations are, for the most part, admirable;
but in the course of the processes, in the answering of examination
questions, the unexpected constantly happens, and it is
the unlooked-for results, the “surprises” of the occasions, that
make sport for the Philistines. The situation on this head is
easily explicable. It is a natural result of the modern system
of preparation for examination—the cram system. Examinees
bent only on “getting through” will answer questions on the
hit-or-miss principle, while others, whose brains have become
more or less addled under the pressure of “memory work,”
will evolve from their unbalanced inner consciousness replies
fearfully and wonderfully made.</p>

<p>Some of the “exam.” stories current in educational circles,
though characteristic, and possibly “founded on fact,” have an
air of belonging to the too-good-to-be-true category. A number
of these are told against—and, if invented, were probably
invented by—undergraduates. Thus—so the story goes—an
undergraduate was asked to name the minor prophets, and, not
having “got them up,” neatly and politely replied that he
would rather not make invidious distinctions. Another university
man, called upon to give the parable of the Good Samaritan,
did so correctly enough until he came to the passage
where the Samaritan said to the innkeeper: “When I come
again I will repay thee,” to which he added, “This he said,
knowing that he would see his face no more.” Perhaps, however,
the examinee upon this occasion was a conscious humorist,
and had in mind the worldly-wise saying, that there are a
great many people willing to play the part of the Good Samaritan,
less the oil and the twopence.</p>

<p>Something of the same stamp must have been the candidate
for a degree, who, asked to state the substance of St. Paul’s
sermon at Athens, said that it was “crying out for two hours,
‘Great is Diana of the Ephesians.’” With variations, that is
the substance of a great many sermons, and of other discourses
beside sermons.</p>

<p>Such stories as the above may or may not be rather broadly
illustrative than strictly true, but in any case they can be pretty
well matched by others, about the truthfulness of which there
is no doubt. Every year a certain proportion of the children
of the London board schools enter into a competitive examination
in Scriptural knowledge, for the “Peek Prizes,”
which consist of handsomely got-up Bibles and Testaments.
They are “paper work” examinations, and the following are
a few of the many curious “hash” answers that have at various
times been put in at them.</p>

<p>“Abraham was the father of Lot, and ad tew wives. One
was called Hishmale and tother Haggar, he kept wun at home,
and he turned tother into the desert where she became a pillow
of salt in the day time, and a pillow of fire by night.”</p>

<p>“Joseph wore a koat of many garments. He was chief butler
to Faro and told is dreams. He married Potiffers dortor, and
he led the Gypshans out of bondage to Kana in Gallilee, and
there fell on his sword and died in sight of the promised land.”</p>

<p>“Moses was an Egypshion. He lived in a hark made of
bulrushes, and he kept a golden calf and worshipt brazen
snakes, and he het nothing but kwales and manner for forty
year. He was kort by the air of his ed while riding under the
bow of a tree and he was killed by his son Absolon as he was
hangin from the bow. His end was pease.”</p>

<p>Of the numerous stories told in connection with diocesan
inspection “exams.” in public elementary schools, the two
following are perhaps the best known and most worth quoting.
At one of these exams., a boy, asked to mention the occasion
upon which it is recorded in Scripture that an animal spoke,
made answer: “The whale when it swallowed Jonah.” The
inspector, being something of a humorist, maintained his
gravity and asked: “What did the whale say?” To which
the boy promptly replied: “Almost thou persuadest me to be
a Christian.” Another inspector, finding a class hesitating
over answering the question, “With what weapon did Samson
slay the Philistines?” and wishing to prompt them, significantly
tapped his own cheek, and asked, “What is this?” and his
action touching “the chords of memory,” the whole class instantly
answered: “The jawbone of an ass.”</p>

<p>A good example of the manner in which students who are
“in” for several “subjects” at the same time get their
ideas mixed, is that of the youth who having to answer the
question, “Who was Esau?” replied; “Esau was a man who
wrote fables, and sold the copyright for a bottle of potash.”
Here the confusion thrice confounded of Esau and Æsop,
birthright and copyright, and pottage and potash, is really admirable
in its way.</p>

<p>As might be expected, the examinations of medical students
afford some good stories—true or otherwise. As might also be
expected, some of them are wittily impudent. For instance, a
“badgering” examiner asked a student what means he would
employ to induce copious perspiration in a patient, and got for
answer: “I’d try to make him pass an examination before
you, sir.” The most frequently cited anecdote of this kind is
that of the brusque examiner—said by some to have been Dr.
Abernethy—who, losing patience with a student who had answered
badly, exclaimed: “Perhaps, sir, you could tell me the
names of the muscles I would put in action if I were to kick
you?” “Undoubtedly, sir,” came the prompt reply; “you
would put into motion the flexors and extensors of my arm,
for I should knock you down.” On the same lines as this was
the retort made to M. Lefebvre de Fourcy, a French examiner,
celebrated, not only for his learning, but also for his severity
and rudeness. He was examining a youth, who, though well
up in his work, hesitated over answering one of the questions
put to him. Losing temper at this, the examiner shouted to an
attendant: “Bring a truss of hay for this young gentleman’s
breakfast.” “Bring two,” coolly added the examinee, “Monsieur
and I will breakfast together.” Of such alleged answers
by students as that the pancreas was so named after the Midland
railway station, that the bone of the upper arm (<i>humerus</i>)
was called the humerous, and was so styled because it was
known as the funny-bone; or that the ankle-bone (<i>tarsus</i>) was
so called because St. Paul walked upon it to the city of that
name—of such alleged answers as these it is charitable to suppose
that they must be weak inventions of the enemy.</p>

<p>Many of the comicalities in the way of examination answers
recorded by her Majesty’s inspectors of schools, the examiners
in the school board scholarships competitions, and other the
like official personages, go a long way to prove that in examination
blundering, as in many other matters, truth is sometimes
stranger than fiction. At least, it seems to us that no invented
story—supposing examination stories ever are invented—could
equal for “nice derangement” the following written answer
which was actually given at an examination in the “specific
subjects” in a public elementary school within the metropolitan
area. The specific subject taken was physiology, and the
children “presented” in it were asked to “describe the processes
of digestion,” which one of them did in this wise:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
“Food is digested by the action of the lungs. Digestion is
brought on by the lungs having something the matter with
them. The food then passes through your windpipe to the
pores, and thus passes off your body by evaporation, through
a lot of little holes in your skin called capillaries. The food
is nourished in the stomach. If you were to eat anything hard
you would not be able to digest it, and the consequence would
be you would have indigestion. The gall-bladder throws off
juice from the food which passes through it. We call the kidneys
the bread-basket, because it is where all the bread goes
to. They lay up concealed by the heart.”</p>

<p>Domestic economy, as nowadays taught to “children of the
elementary school class,” embraces a good deal of physiological
knowledge, or rather, as applied to such children, physiological
jargon. It is a subject which affords hosts of amusing
answers, though, from considerations of space, two or three
must here suffice for specimens. Thus, in reply to the question,
“Why do we cook our food?” one girl gives the delightfully
inconsequent reply: “Their of five ways of cooking potatoes.
We should die if we eat our food roar.” Another girl
writes: “The function of food is to do its proper work in the
body. Its proper work is to well masticate the food, and it
goes through without dropping, instead of being pushed down
by the skin.” A third domestic economy pupil puts in her examination
paper that “food digested is when we put it into our
mouths, our teeth chews it, and our tongue roll it down into our
body.… We should not eat so much bone-making
foods as flesh-forming and warmth-giving foods, for if we did
we would have too many bones, and that would make us look
funny.” On the subject of ventilation, one student informs us
that a room should be kept at ninety in the winter by a fire; in
the summer by a thermometer: while a classmate writes: “A
thermometer is an instrument used to let out the heat when it
is going to be cold.” Another girl sets down: “When roasting
a piece of beef place it in front of a brisk fire, so as to congratulate
the outside.” But an answer—still in domestic economy—that
better, perhaps, than any of the above illustrates
the jargoning that comes of the cram system, is the following:
“Sugar is an amyolid, if you was to eat much sugar and
not nothing else you would not live because sugar has not got
no carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen. Potatoes is another
amyolids.”</p>

<p>The definitions sometimes given by children in reply to examination
questioning, are, to say the least of it, original. After
a reading of Gray’s “Elegy” by a fourth-standard class,
the boys were asked what was meant by “fretted vaults,” and
one youth replied: “The vaults in which those poor people
were buried; their friends came and fretted over them.”
Asked what he understood by “elegy,” another boy in the
same class answered: “Elegy is some poetry wrote out for
schools to learn like Gray’s ‘Elegy.’” A class of girls, who
had read a passage from “Evangeline,” were told to write out
the meaning of “the forge,” and these were among the answers,
“A firnest in a blacksmith shop.” “A firnest in a
blacksmith.” “The village smithy’s anvil.” “The dust that
rises from the floor of a blacksmith’s.” A teacher, giving a
reading lesson to his class in the presence of an inspector, asked
the boys what was meant by conscience—a word that had occurred
in the course of the reading. The class having been duly
crammed for the question, answered as one boy: “An inward
monitor.” “But what do you understand by an inward monitor?”
put in the inspector. To this further question only one
boy announced himself ready to respond, and his triumphantly
given answer was, “A hironclad, sir.”</p>

<p>A few years back there was published, as a curiosity, in its
way, the subjoined transcript from Cowper’s poem on Alexander
Selkirk written (from dictation) by a fifth-standard boy at
a government examination of a public elementary school: “I
Ham Monac of hall I searve, there is none heare my rite to
Dispute from the senter. Hall round to the sea I am lorde of
the fowls to the Brute all shoshitude ware are the charms that
sages have sene in thy face better Dewel in miste of a larms
than in this moste horribel place. I am how of umity reach if

i start at the sound of my hone the Beasts that rome over the
place my form with indrifence see they are so unocent with men
such tamess is shocking to me.”</p>

<p>The examiner for the School Board Scholarship competed
for in 1882, gives the following among other equally strange
answers on historical matters. “When Commonwealth comes
to the throne it is called Oliver Cromwell.” “The treaty of
Utrecht was fought between the Zulus and the English.”
“Lord Clive captured the Fiji Islands in 1624.” “Cardinal
Wolsey was a great warrior.” “Walpole translated the Bible.”
“Walpole was another favorite of Henry VIII. He was the
chief man in helping Henry to get a divorce.” “Chaucer wrote
Æsop’s fables.” In another of these scholarship examinations
Jack Cade was described as “a great Indian conqueror,” Sir
Christopher Wren was set down as “a discoverer” and “an
animal painter,” and Mr. Gladstone as “a great African
traveler.” The battle of Crecy was stated to have been fought
in the reign of George III., between the Britons and Romans,
and “The Wide, Wide World” was named as Shakspere’s
greatest work. This last, however, was not so bad as the history
of a pupil-teacher, who informed the examiner that
“Shakspere lived in the reign of George III., discovered
America, and was killed by Caliban.”</p>

<p>A schoolboy habit of placing upon a question some literal
meaning other than that intended by the examiner, often leads
to answers as curious as unexpected. Thus an inspector, testing
a class upon their knowledge of the succession of the kings
of Israel, asked the boy to whose turn it had come to be questioned:
“And who came after Solomon?” To which the
youngster answered: “The Queen of Sheba, sir.” Asked what
were the chief ends of man, another boy replied, “His head
and feet;” and a third, questioned as to where Jacob was going
when he was ten years old, replied that he was “going on
for eleven.” One specially practical juvenile, called upon to say
for what the Red Sea was famous, answered, “Red herrings!”</p>

<p>To the type of answers here in view, belongs an answer given
by a boy whose father was a strong teetotaler, and upon whom
it would appear home influence had made a stronger impression
than school lessons. “Do you know the meaning of syntax?”
he was asked. “Yes,” he answered; “sin-tax is the
dooty upon spirits.” An inspector, who had been explaining
to a class that the land of the world was not continuous, said
to the boy who happened to be standing nearest to him:
“Now, could your father walk round the world?” “No, sir,”
was promptly answered. “Why not?” “Because he’s dead,”
was the unlooked-for response. As little anticipated, probably,
was the answer made to another inspector, who asked, “What
is a hovel?” and was met with the reply: “What you live in.”</p>

<p>A prettily humorous examination story is that of the little
Scotch boy at the Presbytery examination. He was asked:
“What is the meaning of regeneration?” “To be born again,”
he answered. “Quite right! Would you not like to be born
again?” He hesitated, but being pressed, said that he would
not, and asked why not, replied: “For fear I might be born a
lassie.” Alike astonishing and amusing was an answer given
by an adult examinee, who was “sitting” for a certificate as
acting teacher. In the examination to test general knowledge,
he was asked, “What is the age of reason?” and answered:
“As many years as have elapsed since the birth of the person
so named.” It was also a certificate candidate, who, in reading,
rendered two lines from Goldsmith’s “Edwin and Angelina”
thus:—</p>

<p>The “Critical and Exegetical Hand-book to the Gospel of Matthew,”<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>
now given to American readers with an admirable preface by Dr.
Crooks, is just what the title asserts, a critical exegesis of the text. The
author was a thorough linguist, and especially familiar with the language
in which Matthew wrote. His expositions, which are accurately
grammatical, give evidence of much philological research, and a strict,
attention to the <i>usus loquendi</i> of both classic and New Testament Greek.
As an exegete he ranks with the best; albeit, the exegesis itself is, at
times, clearer than the English used to state it. Some sentences are burdened
with adjuncts, and there is not always the most felicitous arrangement
of the explanatory clauses. One familiar with good writing will
occasionally feel an impulse to recast and improve what does not quite
suit him. For professional men, and especially young ministers, the
Hand-book has great value, and is worthy of their careful study.</p>

<p>At least one novel book has been issued among the recent holiday
volumes. It is “One Year’s Sketch Book,”<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> a collection of engravings
following the birth, growth, and death of a year. Flowers are made to
interpret the changing phases of the seasons by the artist, for, though she
weaves in many landscapes, they are almost always as backgrounds, for
now a bunch of ox-eyed daisies, a bouquet of blue violets, a loose cluster
of roses, a spray of clematis, or a bunch of bitter-sweet. She deals more
sympathetically, too, with flowers than with other subjects, and her work
on them shows much more finish. There are several anachronisms in
the book that are annoying. March is made to follow May; the page
called the end of spring-time bears a cluster of trailing arbutus as its
emblem, a flower which belongs to the birth of spring; and in her preface,
she makes her newly wedded birds hesitate between nest building
in the locust, with its “drooping white blossoms heaving with sweetness,”
and the apple trees with their “pink and white glory blushing
against the sky,” forgetful that the “pink and white glory” has fallen to
the ground before the locust flower has come. The pictures are quite
as beautiful, however, as if placed in strict calendar order, and the make
up of the book is delightful.</p>

<p>Probably the most suggestive work on education ever written is Rousseau’s
“Emile.”<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> It is the work to which we owe the common sense
and the thoughtful training which more and more characterize our system
of education. It is the work which aroused Pestalozzi and Frœbel,
but it has been for many years practically a dead volume, particularly to
English readers. Old, poorly translated, long, and with many tedious
digressions, teachers and mothers who ought to have been reading it
were repelled by these difficulties. Some time ago M. Jules Steeg removed
these barriers from his French countrymen by arranging a volume
into which he gathered the most valuable portions of Emile, and
now one of our country-women has removed the difficulties from English
readers by a clear translation of Mr. Steeg’s work. It is a book
worth possessing, and educators ought to welcome this practical and
satisfactory arrangement of Rousseau’s great book.</p>

<p>A jest book and a history are not often found in the same volume, but
the “Enchiridion of Wit,”<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> is not only what it professes, a hand book of
English conversational wit; it is a very delightful history of certain
periods of English court and society life. The author has adopted the
novel plan of arranging chronologically the <i>bon-mots</i> he has collected.
The effect is very striking. This grouping into periods enables a reader
to study the progress, the men, the culture and refinement of each age from
an entirely new standpoint, and one which no other book with which
we are familiar makes possible. The volume will form a valuable handbook
in studies of the education and polish of the social and literary
coteries from the time of Sir Thomas Moore down to the days of
Thackeray and Bishop Wilberforce.</p>

<p>“A Penniless Girl”<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> is the story of one who, simply because she was
a girl, could not inherit the immense fortune which would have fallen
to a son. Her father’s disappointment, and neglect of the daughter
whose mother died at her birth, her reception into the house of a wealthy
noble family where, after she had been well educated, she accepted the
position of governess; and her struggles to free herself from the meshes
spread on all sides to lead her into a marriage for wealth and position,
and to remain true to herself and the man she loved, make up the plot.
It is a book that will help while away an hour or so very pleasantly.</p>

<p>A few short extracts from the first page of “Episodes of My Second
Life”<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> give the meaning of the title. “On the 15th of August, 1836, I
was born again. On that day I embarked at Gibraltar for New York,
being then twenty-five years old. It was the beginning of a new life.”
The author is an Italian, and had passed his seventieth birthday before
beginning this book. It is made up principally of reminiscences of his
life in America and in England. His comments on some of the customs
of American social life give us a not very flattering view of ourselves as
others sometimes see us. His appreciation of the treasures of English
literature is very great, and his commendation of them as warm as his
denunciation of French literature is bitter. His patriotic, diplomatic,
literary, parliamentary, and journalistic experiences give quite an insight
into these great fields of labor. There is much of egotism within its
pages, but the book is very readable and possesses literary merit.</p>

<p>“Light Ahead”<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> is one of those satisfactory books in which the poor
good characters all turn out well, and have abundant opportunity to
heap coals of fire on the heads of the bad rich ones, who in former
years had treated them with contempt. The story of the little <i>spirituelle</i>
Alice, who, from a refined home where poverty dwelt, won her way among
the noble and the true in the highest circles, until she gained an established
position in the very best society, will do good wherever it goes.</p>

<p>“Pretty Lucy Merwyn”<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> is a charming story for the young. There
is a freshness and an individuality about it that captivates the reader
from the first. The racy, original little speeches of Lucy and her companions
have in them a naturalness that is seldom found, and the descriptions
of their travels abroad are so vivid that those reading half believe
that they themselves are visiting the “memory haunted lands beyond
the seas.” It is written in good style and in the purest English.</p>

<p>Marion Harland, with her usual good sense in taking everything new
and good into the kitchen, has prepared a “Calendar”<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> for housewives.
It is the aptest device we have ever seen for furnishing a daily inspiration
to model housekeeping. No woman with a spark of household pride in
her soul can pull away the leaves of this pretty calendar day by day and
read the bright thoughts, the practical hints, and the encouraging words
which Mrs. Terhune has put on them without profit. It is a pretty object,
too, for a wall, with its richly colored sketch of Marion Harland
herself, sitting in the corner of her library.</p>

<p>A choice little book is the one containing two brief sketches called
“Miss Toosey’s Mission” and “Laddie.”<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a> One experiences something
of a sense of wrong on looking in vain at the title page for the
author’s name. Both stories are written in a delightful manner, and
find their way straight to one’s heart. Would that there were more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
like poor Miss Toosey, who grieve over making just such failures of
their lives as she thought she had. Could she only have known of the
purpose which she fanned to life in the breast of strong John Rossiter to
go into the mission field and really do what she so fondly dreamed of
once, she would have felt that she had wrought “better than she knew.”</p>

<p>The “Laddie” was a prominent physician in London, who years before
as an uncommonly promising youth had left his simple rural home
and poor mother. The story tells of how she went to find him, and the
thoughtless words he spoke which made her leave his grand house, and
of the long search he had for her and the sad finding.</p>

<p>The firm, convinced statements of Dr. Van Dyke in “The Reality of
Religion”<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> are a welcome change from much “popular” writing and
preaching on religious themes. To him there is no question of the truths of
the Bible. God is <i>manifest</i> as a physical reality, a moral reality, an historical
reality, a spiritual reality. The saving power of the Cross of Christ
is no theory; it is a fact. The whole is ringing with the perfect confidence
the writer feels in the living truths which he presents. It carries
in its tone conviction. The book is a strong argument for what it
teaches. If one man has found such perfect knowledge no reader can
afford to overlook his experience. It is a forcible appeal to unbelievers;
it is splendid help to wavering minds.</p>

<p>Mrs. Harrison, in writing “The Old Fashioned Fairy Book”<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a> has not
only opened up a world of delight for little readers in which they can
amuse themselves by the hour, but has also conferred a great favor upon
mothers and many other older persons by putting into their hands the
means by which they may be enabled to respond to the oft repeated wish,
“tell us a story, please.” The book is a treasure house in which one
may find that which will suit any hour and any mood. There are tales
of dwarfs and witches, and “lots of fairies,” and lovely princesses, and
brave champions, and all the rest of the things that belong to fairy lore.
And charming illustrations set off the whole book; even the cover is a
delight.</p>

<p>We are pleased to welcome a complete collection of Lucy Larcom’s
poems.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a> For many years she has been sending out her fresh, loving
verses, until she has won a warm place in the hearts of earnest readers.
Her poems possess beside a real melody in versification, a pure, devotional
tone which makes them something better than merely pleasing; it
makes them inspiring. Her deep appreciation of nature, her quick sympathy
with the sorrowing and the tempted, her tender love for childhood,
fill her poems, making them most beautiful collections for lovers of
verse.</p>

<p>“How We Live”<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a> is a little book finely illustrated, that treats of
Physiology and Hygiene. It is adapted to the use of scholars in the
elementary schools. The chapters are short, well arranged, and clearly
expressed; at the end of each is a list of questions upon the subjects
taught in the chapter, put in a novel and interesting manner. The effects
of alcohol and narcotics upon the system are pointed out, but great
care has been taken not to exaggerate the statements, as is too often the
tendency in a work of this nature. The book merits a welcome from
all parents, who should see that their children are learning just
such lessons as it teaches, and so growing up to be strong men and
women.</p>

<p>One of the new series of Appleton’s Science Text-Books is a Compend
of Geology.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a> The aim of the author has been to make an interesting
as well as an instructive book, and to direct the attention of scholars
to the phenomena now occurring on all sides. No roundabout
method for leading up to the study proper has been used, but the author
has very simply commenced at the beginning. The directness of the
whole book is one of its best features. His method of unfolding the science
is at once easy and natural, and can not fail to awaken and retain the
close attention of the student. The definitions are clear, concise, and
simply stated; the illustrations are numerous and finely supplement the
text.</p>

<p>A very neat little book is that called “Vocal and Action Language.”<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[R]</a>
In a carefully prepared introduction the objections against the study of
elocution are very fairly met, and its necessity, importance and history
set forth. Public speakers can gather many a useful hint from its pages
aside from the practical drill lessons which it contains.</p>

<h3>CHAUTAUQUA SCHOOL OF CHURCH WORK.</h3>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">Rev. Geo. P. Hays, D.D., Director, Box 2529, Denver, Colorado.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>This school is designed to do whatever may be found practicable
in training Christians for official position in their
churches, and for personal effort for the conversion of their
acquaintances and friends. With this in view, it is divided
into two departments, and will during the summer session of
1885 hold two sessions per day.</p>

<p><i>Official Duty.</i>—This department will hold a morning session.
Here the theory of all official authority and influence,
and the best methods of meeting the same, will be studied in
their scriptural statements, their abstract application in the
rules of business and of the church, and their concrete illustrations
in the lives of successful officers in the church and the
world.</p>

<p><i>Personal Effort.</i>—This department will hold an afternoon
session, at which the Scriptural obligation to work as individuals
will be carefully considered, and, afterward, the best
methods of dealing with our friends as to their objections, their
fears, and their indifference. In both departments an effort
will be made duly to appreciate personal peculiarities, and yet
for all make the experience of others as useful as possible.</p>

<p>The stationery adopted for the classes of ’87 and ’88 is out,
and very pretty it is, too. Mr. Henry Hart, of Atlanta, Ga.,
manufactures and sells the paper for these classes. The satisfaction
which his badges have given is the best recommendation
for his stationery. Readers of the C. L. S. C. who may
wish to secure either badges or paper will reach Mr. Hart by
addressing Atlanta, Ga.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Alma Mater</i>, No. 3, which has just been sent to all members
of the C. L. S. C., is the first number for the current year
1884-5. Four numbers will be sent during the year, but on
account of some necessary changes, the various “lessons” in
every-day speech, self-discipline, etc., will not appear in the
order first announced. The readings in each of the four numbers
will be <i>required</i>, but not in connection with the work of
any one month.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Members of the class of ’88 should send items of particular
interest to the class to the Rev. C. C. McLean, Jacksonville,
Florida. Mr. McLean has been chosen to prepare class matter
for <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>. Do not let him lack for news.
Those items which interest you as a “Plymouth Rock” will
interest your classmates.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
